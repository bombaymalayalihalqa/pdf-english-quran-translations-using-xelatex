Alif. Lam. Mim.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][2]

\flushleft{
This is the Book of Allah: there is no doubt about it. It is guidance to Godfearing people,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][3]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
who believe in the unseen, establish the Salats and expend (in Our way) out of what We have bestowed on them;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][4]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
who believe in the Book We have sent down to you (i.e. the Qur'an) and in the Books sent down before you, and firmly believe in the Hereafter.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][5]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Such people are on the right way from their Lord and such are truly successful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][6]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
As for those who have rejected (these things), it is all the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them: they are not going to believe.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][7]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Allah has sealed up their hearts and ears and a covering has fallen over their eyes, and they have incurred the severest punishment.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][8]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then there are some who say, "We believe in Allah and the Last Day", whereas they do not believe at all.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][9]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They thus try to deceive Allah and the Believers, but they succeed in deceiving none except themselves and they realize it not.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][10]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
In their hearts is a disease which Allah has increased all the more and a painful doom is in store for them for the lie they utter.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][11]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Whenever it is said to them, "Spread not disorder on the earth", their reply is, "We only seek to put things aright".
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][12]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Beware! they do spread disorder but they realize it not.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][13]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when it is said to them, "Believe sincerely as the other people have believed", they reply, "Should we believe as fools have believed?" Beware! they themselves are the fools, but they know it not.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][14]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When they meet those who believe, they say, "We, too, are believers", but when they privily meet their evil geniuses, they say, "Indeed we are with you: we are only mocking at these people".
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][15]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(Little do they realize that) Allah is mocking at them. He gives them rope enough, and they wander on and on blindly in their mischief and rebellion.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][16]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
These are the people who have bartered away Guidance for error, but this is a profitless bargain that they have made, and they are not at all on the right way.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][17]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Their condition may be described in a parable: a man kindled a fire and when it illuminated all around him, Allah took away the light from their eyes and left them in utter darkness, where they could not see anything.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They are deaf; they are dumb; they are blind so they will not return (to the right way).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or (still another parable may be cited to depict their condition): heavy rain is falling from the sky, accompanied by pitch darkness, thunder and lightning. When they hear the thunderclap, they thrust their fingers into their ears for fear of death, but Allah is encircling the disbelievers on all sides.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The lightning terrifies them as if it were going to snatch away their eyesight from them. When they see light, they move on a little further and When it becomes dark for them, they stand still. Had Allah so willed, He could have deprived them totally of their hearing and their sight. Most surely Allah has power over everything.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][21]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
O Mankind, submit to your Lord Who created you and those who were before you; in this way only you may expect to save yourselves.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
It is He Who has made the earth a bed for you and the sky a canopy; and it is He Who sends down rain from above for the growth of every kind of food products for your sustenance. So, when you know this, you should not set up equals to rank with Allah.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][23]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And if you be in doubt whether the Book We have sent down to Our Servant is from Us or not, then produce, at least, one Surah like this. You may call all your associates to assist you and avail yourselves of the help of any one other than Allah. If you are genuine in your doubt, do this.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][24]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But if you do not do this, and you can never do this, then fear the Fire which has been prepared for the disbelievers and which shall have men and stones for fuel.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][25]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And give good news (O Muhammad), to those who believe in this Book and do good deeds (in accordance with its teachings). For them there will be gardens underneath which canals flow. Their fruits will so resemble the fruits on the Earth that every time they will be provided with fruits, they will say, "Such fruits were provided to us before on the Earth. " And there will be pure spouses for them and therein they will live for ever.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][26]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Well, Allah is not ashamed to cite the similitude of a gnat or of something even more insignificant than this. As for those who believe, they come to know from the same similitude that it is the Revelation from their Lord; but those who disbelieve, say, "What does Allah mean by such similitudes?" Allah leads astray many and guides many to the right way by the same thing. And He leads astray only those who disobey Allah;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][27]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
who break Allah's covenant after ratifying it; who cut asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined, and who produce chaos on the Earth. These are the people who are indeed the losers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][28]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
How is it that you adopt the attitude of disbelief towards Allah when the fact is that you were lifeless and He gave you life, and He will take away life from you and will again restore you to life: then you shall ultimately return to Him.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He it is Who created for you all that there is on the Earth; He then turned to the sky and ordered it into seven heavens. And He has full knowledge of everything.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][30]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Just recall the time when your Lord said to the angels, "I am going to appoint a vicegerent on the Earth." They humbly enquired, "Are you going to appoint such a one as will cause disorder and shed blood on the Earth? We are already engaged in hymning Your praise, and hallowing Your name".
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Allah replied, "I know what you do not know." After this he taught Adam the names of all things. Then He set these before the angels and asked, "Tell Me the names of these things, if you are right (in thinking that the appointment of a vicegerent will cause disorder)".
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They replied, "Glory be to You. You alone are free from defect. We possess only that much knowledge which You have given us. Indeed You alone are All-Knowing and All-Wise."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then Allah said to Adam, "Tell them the names of these things." When Adam told them the names of all those things, Allah declared, "Did I not tell you that I know those truths about the Earth and the Heavens which are hidden from you? I know what you disclose and what you hide."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][34]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We commanded the angels, "Bow yourselves to Adam. "All bowed but Iblis refused to do so; he waxed proud and joined the defiers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][35]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We said, "O Adam, you and your wife, both dwell in the Garden and eat to your hearts' content where from you will, but do not go near this tree; otherwise you shall become transgressors"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
After a time Satan tempted them with that tree to disobey. Our Command and brought them out of the state they were in, and We decreed, "Now, go down all of you from here; you are enemies of one another. Henceforth you shall dwell and provide for yourselves on the Earth for a specified period."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
At that time Adam learnt appropriate words from his Lord and repented, and his Lord accepted his repentance, for He is very Relenting and very Merciful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We said, "Now go down, all of you from here. Henceforth there shall come to you Guidance from Me now and again: whoever will follow it shall have neither fear nor sorrow
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][39]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and whoever will refuse to accept it and defy Our Revelations they shall be doomed to the Fire wherein they shall remain for ever.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][40]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
O children of Israel! Just recall to mind My favour wherewith I blessed you fulfil your covenant with Me and I shall fulfil My covenant with you, and fear Me alone.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And believe in the Book I have now sent down; as it confirms the Scriptures you already possess, be not the first to reject it; barter not away My Revelations for paltry worldly gain, and guard yourselves against My wrath
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][42]

Confound not the Truth with falsehood nor conceal it knowingly.

Establish the Salat, pay the Zakat and bow down before Me along with those who bow down.

How is it that you enjoin others to follow the Right Way, but forget it yourselves, though you read the Scriptures? Have you no sense at all?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][45]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Seek help with the Salat and fortitude: no doubt, Salat is a hard task but not for those obedient servants,

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][46]

who realize that ultimately they shall meet their Lord and shall return to Him.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][47]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
O Children of Israel! Just recall to mind My favour that bestowed upon you, and remember that I exalted you above all the peoples of the world.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][48]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And guard yourselves against the Day when no one shall avail anyone anything; nor shall intercession be accepted from anyone; nor shall anyone be acquitted for any (amount of) ransom; nor shall the guilty ones be helped from any quarter.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][49]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Recall the time when We delivered you from the slavery of Pharaoh's people. They had inflicted a dreadful torment on you: they killed your sons and let your daughters live. And in this there was a hard trial for you from your your Lord.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][50]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Remember the time when We parted the sea to make way for you and let you pass safely through it and then drowned Pharaoh's people before your very eyes.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][51]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Call to mind that when We invited Moses for a fixed term of forty nights and days, you took to calf worship in his absence. Though you had committed a wicked transgression,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][52]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
yet We pardoned you even after that so that you might become grateful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][53]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Remember that (at that very time, when you were committing this gross iniquity) We gave Moses the Book and the criterion of right and wrong so that you might be guided aright.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][54]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Remember that when Moses (returned with the Divine Gift, he) said to his people, "O my people, you have wronged yourselves grievously by taking the calf for worship. Therefore, turn to your Creator. in penitence and slay the guilty ones among you. This is best for you in the sight of your Creator." At that time your Creator accepted your repentance because He is Relenting 'and Merciful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][55]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Remember when you said, "O Moses, we are not going to believe you until we see with our own eyes Allah (talking to you)". At that very time a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on and you fell lifeless.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][56]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We raised you to life so that you might become grateful for this favour.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][57]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(Remember that) We caused the cloud to overshadow you and provided you with manna and salva for your food, saying, "Eat of the clean and pure things We have bestowed upon you" (In spite of this, your forefathers violated Our commands:) however, they did not harm Us but harmed only themselves.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][58]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then call to mind the time when We said, "Go into the town' before you and eat to your hearts' content therein, wherefrom you will, but enter the gate bowing down with humility, repeating 'hittatun'; We will forgive your sins and increase the reward of the righteous".
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][59]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But the transgressors perverted the words said to them entirely into a different thing. So We sent down upon the transgressors a severe torment from the sky: that was the punishment for the disobedience they were showing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][60]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Remember that when Moses prayed for water for his people, We answered, "Strike the rock with your staff": whereupon twelve springs gushed forth from it; the people of every clan came to know their drinking place. (Then they were enjoined:) "Eat and drink of what Allah has provided and do not spread disorder on the earth."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][61]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Remember: You grumbled: "O Moses, we cannot endure one and the same sort of food. Pray your Lord to bring for us the products of the earth green herbs, vegetables, corn, garlic, onions, pulses and the like." Moses replied: "What! would you exchange that which is meaner for that which is nobler? Well, go and live in a town and you will get there what you demand." By and by, they became so degraded that disgrace and humiliation, misery and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they incurred Allah's wrath. That was because they began to reject the Revelations of Allah and kill His Messengers without any just cause; that was the consequence of their disobedience and their persistent transgression against the Law.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][62]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Rest assured that whosoever from among the Muslims or the Jews or the Christians or the Sabaeans believes in Allah and the Last Day, and performs good deeds, he will have his reward with his Lord and he will have no cause for fear and grief.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][63]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Call to mind the time when We raised above you the Tur and made a covenant with you, saying, "Hold fast to the Book which We are giving you and bear in mind the commands and precepts contained therein. It is expected that this will lead you on to the paths of virtue and piety."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][64]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But even after that you forsook the Covenant: nevertheless Allah did not withhold His grace and mercy from you; otherwise you would have been utterly ruined long before this.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][65]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And you know well the story of those among you who broke Sabbath. We said to them, "Be apes despised and hated by all.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][66]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thus We made their end a warning to the people of their time and succeeding generations, and an admonition for God-fearing people.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][67]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then call to mind the other event: when Moses said to his people, "Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow," they replied, "Do you mean to have a jest with us?" He answered, "I crave Allah's protection from behaving like ignorant people."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][68]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then they said, "Please make a request to your Lord to give us some details of the cow." Moses answered, "Allah says that the cow should neither be old nor immature but of middle age. Do, therefore, as you are bidden."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][69]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But they further asked, "Please request your Lord to make it clear to us of what colour she should be." Moses answered, "He says that she should be of yellow colour, so deep and bright as to delight the beholders."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][70]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Again they said, "Pray your Lord to specify for us the kind of cow that is required; for cows (of this type) look alike to us. We shall then find her, if God so wills."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][71]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Moses answered, "Allah says that she should be a cow which has not been yoked nor has ploughed the land nor watered the fields; which is sound and whole, without belemish. " Then they cried out, "Now you have given an accurate description. " Then they sacrificed her but they did not appear to be doing this willingly.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][72]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
You should also recall to mind another incident: You slew a man and began to dispute about the murder and accuse one another of it, but Allah had decreed that what you were trying to hide should be disclosed.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][73]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So We commanded, "Strike the corpse of the murdered man with a part of the sacrificed cow. See how Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His Signs, so that you may understand".
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But even after seeing these Signs your hearts hardened and became as hard as rocks; nay, even harder than rocks. For there are some rocks out of which springs gush forth, and others which split open, and water issues out of them; then there are some which tumble down for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you are doing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
O Muslims, do you then expect that these people will accept your invitation and become believers? whereas there have always been among them some who have been hearing the Word of God, understanding it well and then perverting and tampering with it knowingly.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][76]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When they meet those who believe in Muhammad, they say, "We also believe in him." But when they meet one another in private, they say, "Have you got no sense that you disclose to them those things which Allah has revealed to you so that they might bring them as a proof against you before your Lord?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][77]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Do they really not know that Allah is fully aware of what they hide and what they disclose?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then there are among them some un-lettered people who have no knowledge of the Book but depend upon empty hopes and are guided by mere conjecture and guess-work.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][79]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So woe to their learned people, who write the law with their own hands and then say to the people, "This is from Allah," so that they might gain some paltry worldly end. (They do not see that) this writing of their hands will bring woe to them and what they gain thereby will lead to their ruin.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][80]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They also say, "The fire of Hell is not going to touch us, and even if it does at all, it will be only for a few days". Say, "Have you obtained a promise from Allah which He would not break? Or, do you attribute to Allah things you do not know? Why will not the fire of Hell touch you?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][81]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Whoever earns evil and becomes engrossed in sin shall be doomed to Hell and abide therein for ever.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][82]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Only those people who believe and do good deeds, will be the dwellers of the Garden and live there for ever.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][83]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Remember that We made a solemn covenant with the children of Israel to this effect: worship none save Allah: be good to your parents, to your relatives, to the orphans and to the helpless; speak aright with the people: establish the Salat and pay the Zakat. But with the exception of a few, you all slid back from it and are paying no heed to it even now.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][84]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Remember also that We made another solemn covenant with you: you shall not shed blood among yourselves nor expel one another from your homes. And you confirmed it and you are a witness to it.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][85]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But inspite of this, you are killing your brethren and driving them out from their homes and making unjust and aggressive alliances against one another. And when they come to you as captives, you trade on their ransoms whereas their expulsion itself was unlawful for you. Do you then believe in one part of the Scriptures and disbelieve in the other? What other punishment do such people from among you deserve except an ignominious life in this world and the most grievous doom on the Day of Resurrection? Allah is not unaware of what you are doing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][86]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
These are the people who have preferred the worldly life to the life in the Hereafter. Therefore their torment shall not be lightened nor shall help be given to them (from any quarter).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][87]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We gave Moses the Book and sent after him a train of Messengers in succession. Then We sent Jesus, son of Mary, with clear Signs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. Then how is it that whenever a Messenger came to you wish that which did not suit your lusts, you grew rebellious against him, and repudiated some and slew others.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][88]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They say, "Our hearts are secure." Nay, the fact is that Allah has cursed them for their disbelief; so they are little disposed to believe.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][89]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And how are they behaving now towards a Book which has come to them from Allah? Inspite of the fact that it confirms the Scriptures which they already possessed. and, inspite of the fact that, before it came, they used to pray for a signal victory over the disbelievers, they rejected it when it came, although they recognized it. May Allah's curse be upon such disbelievers!
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][90]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
What a mean thing it is with which they delude their minds. They reject the Guidance which Allah has sent down merely because of their grudge why Allah has in His bounty sent it to whom He chose from amongst His servants. They have thus incurred wrath after wrath, and for such disbelievers there is a disgraceful doom.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][91]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When it is said to them, "Believe in that which Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe only in that which has been sent to us", and reject everything else, though it is the Truth and confirms what is with them. Well, ask them, "If you sincerely believed in what was sent down to you, why did you kill the Messengers of Allah (who were sent to you from amongst yourselves)?

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Of these Messengers (whom We sent for the guidance of mankind), We raised some above the others in rank. Among them was one with whom Allah Himself had direct talks. There were others whom He raised high in rank in other ways. Likewise We gave clear signs to Jesus, son of Mary, and supported him with the Holy Spirit. Had Allah so willed the people who had seen clear signs would not have fought against one another after the Prophets. But (it was not Allah's will to prevent people forcibly from differences: so) they disagreed; then some of them accepted the Truth and others rejected it. If Allah had so willed they would have never fought against one another, but Allah does whatever He pleases (to fulfil His designs.

"I might have lain here for a day or a few hours." Allah said, "Nay, you have been lying here in this state for a hundred years: now, just have a look at your food and your drink; they have not become spoiled in the least.

The witnesses should be from among such people whom you approve of as witnesses. When the witnesses are asked to testify, they should not refuse to do so. Do not neglect to reduce to writing your transaction for a specified term, whether it be big or small. Allah considers this more just for you, for it facilitates the establishment of evidence and lessens doubts and suspicions. Of course, there is no harm if you do not put in writing the common transactions you conclude daily on the spot, but in case of commercial transactions you should have witnesses.

The intercalation (of sacred months) is an act of gross infidelity which causes the unbelievers to be led further astray.

And his people came to him rushing. Before this they were wont to commit evil deeds. Lot said: 'My people! Here are my daughters; they are purer for you. Have fear of Allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guests. Is there not even one right-minded person in your midst?'

Thereupon the angels said: 'O Lot! We indeed are messengers of your Lord. And your people will in no way be able to hurt you.

\flushleft{
(O Muhammad), by revealing the Qur'an to you We narrate to you in the best manner the stories of the past although before this narration you were utterly unaware of them.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][4]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Call to mind when Joseph said to his father: "My father! I saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrating themselves before me."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][5]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
His father said: "My son! Do not relate your dream to your brothers lest they hatch a plot to harm you. Indeed Satan is man's open enemy.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][6]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(As you have seen in the dream), so will your Lord choose you (for His task) and will impart to you the comprehension of the deeper meaning of things and will bestow the full measure of His favour upon you and upon the house of Jacob even as He earlier bestowed it in full measure upon your forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Surely your Lord is All- Knowing, All-Wise."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][7]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Verily in the story of Joseph and his brothers there are many signs for those who inquire (about the truth).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][8]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And call to mind when the brothers of Joseph conferred together and said: "Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, although we are a group of so many. Our father is clearly mistaken.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][9]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So either kill Joseph or cast him into some distant land so that your father's attention may become exclusively yours. And after so doing become righteous."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][10]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thereupon one of them said: "Do not kill Joseph, but if you are bent upon doing something, cast him down to the bottom of some dark pit, perhaps some caravan passing by will take him out of it."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][11]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
After so deciding they said to their father: "Why is it that you do not trust us regarding Joseph although we are his true well-wishers?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][12]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Send him out with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play while we will be there, standing guard over him."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][13]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Their father answered: "It grieves me indeed that you should take him with you for I fear that some wolf might eat him up while you are negligent of him."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][14]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said: "Should a wolf eat him, despite the presence of our strong group, we would indeed be a worthless lot!"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][15]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So when they went away with Joseph and decided to cast him in the bottom of the dark pit, We revealed to Joseph: "Surely a time will come when you will remind them of their deed. They know nothing about the consequence of what they are doing."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][16]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
At nightfall they came to their father weeping
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][17]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and said: "Father! We went racing with one another and left Joseph behind with our things, and then a wolf came and ate him up. We know that you will not believe us howsoever truthful we might be."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they brought Joseph's shirt, stained with false blood. Seeing this their father exclaimed: "Nay (this is not true); rather your evil souls have made it easy for you to commit a heinous act. So I will bear this patiently, and in good grace. It is Allah's help alone that I seek against your fabrication."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And a caravan came, and they sent their water drawer to draw water. As he let down his bucket in the well he (observed Joseph) and cried out: "This is good news. There is a boy." They concealed him, considering him as part of their merchandise, while Allah was well aware of what they did.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Later they sold him for a paltry sum - just a few dirhams; they did not care to obtain a higher price.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][21]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The man from Egypt who bought him said to his wife: "Take good care of him, possibly he might be of benefit to us or we might adopt him as a son." Thus We found a way for Joseph to become established in that land and in order that We might teach him to comprehend the deeper meaning of things. Allah has full power to implement His design although most people do not know that.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when Joseph reached the age of maturity, We granted him judgement and knowledge. Thus do We reward those who do good.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][23]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And it so happened that the lady in whose house Joseph was living, sought to tempt him to herself, and one day bolting the doors she said: "Come on now!" Joseph answered: "May Allah grant me refuge! My Lord has provided an honourable abode for me (so how can I do something so evil)? Such wrong-doers never prosper."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][24]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And she advanced towards him, and had Joseph not perceived a sign from his Lord he too would have advanced towards her. Thus was Joseph shown a sign from his Lord that We might avert from him all evil and indecency, for indeed he was one of Our chosen servants.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][25]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then both of them rushed to the door, each seeking to get ahead of the other, and she tore Joseph's shirt from behind. Then both of them found the husband of the lady at the door. Seeing him she said: "What should be the punishment of him who has foul designs on your wife except that he should be imprisoned or subjected to painful chastisement?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][26]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Joseph said: "It is she who was trying to tempt me to herself." And a witness belonging to her own household testified (on grounds of circumstantial evidence): "If his shirt is torn from the front, then she is telling the truth and he is a liar.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][27]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But if his shirt is torn from behind, then she has lied, and he is truthful."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][28]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So when the husband saw Joseph's shirt torn from behind he exclaimed: "Surely, this is one of the tricks of you women; your tricks are indeed great.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Joseph, disregard this. And you - woman - ask forgiveness for your sin, for indeed it is you who has been at fault."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][30]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And some ladies in the city began to say: "The chief's wife, violently in love with her houseboy, is out to tempt him. We think she is clearly mistaken."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Hearing of their sly talk the chief's wife sent for those ladies, and arranged for them a banquet, and got ready couches, and gave each guest a knife. Then, while they were cutting and eating the fruit, she signalled Joseph: "Come out to them." When the ladies saw him they were so struck with admiration that they cut their hands, exclaiming: "Allah preserve us. This is no mortal human. This is nothing but a noble angel!"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
She said: "So now you see! This is the one regarding whom you reproached me. Indeed I tried to tempt him to myself but he held back, although if he were not to follow my order, he would certainly be imprisoned and humiliated."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Joseph said: "My Lord! I prefer imprisonment to what they ask me to do. And if You do not avert from me the guile of these women, I will succumb to their attraction and lapse into ignorance."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][34]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thereupon his Lord granted his prayer, and averted their guile from him. Surely He alone is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][35]

\flushleft{
Then it occurred to them to cast Joseph into prison for a while even though they had seen clear signs (of Joseph's innocence and of the evil ways of their ladies).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And with Joseph two other slaves entered the prison. One of them said: "I saw myself pressing wine in a dream"; and the other said: "I saw myself carrying bread on my head of which the birds were eating." Both said: "Tell us what is its interpretation; for we consider you to be one of those who do good."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Joseph said: "I will inform you about the interpretation of the dreams before the arrival of the food that is sent to you. This knowledge is part of what I have been taught by my Lord. I have renounced the way of those who do not believe in Allah, and who deny the Hereafter,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and I have adopted the way of my forefathers - Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It is not for us to associate any with Allah in His Divinity. It is out of Allah's grace upon us and upon mankind (that He did not require of us to serve any other than Allah), and yet most people do not give thanks.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][39]

Fellow-prisoners! Is it better that there be diverse lords, or just Allah, the One, the Irresistible?

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][40]

\flushleft{
Those whom you serve beside Him are merely idle names that you and your fathers have fabricated, without Allah sending down any sanction for them. All authority to govern rests only with Allah. He has commanded that you serve none but Him. This is the Right Way of life, though most people are altogether unaware.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][41]

\flushleft{
Fellow-prisoners! (This is the interpretation of your dreams): one of you will serve wine to his lord (the king of Egypt). As for the other, he will be crucified and birds will eat of his head. The question concerning what you asked has thus been decided."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Joseph said to the one of the two prisoners who he knew would be set free: "Mention me in your lord's presence." But Satan caused him to forget mentioning this to his lord (the ruler of Egypt) and so Joseph languished in prison for several years.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And once the king said: "I have dreamt that there are seven fat cows and seven lean cows are devouring them, and there are seven fresh green ears of corn and seven others dry and withered. My nobles! Tell me what is the interpretation of this dream, if you are well-versed in interpretation of dreams."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

They said: "These are confused dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of such dreams."

Then of the two prisoners, the one who had been set free, now remembered, after the lapse of a long period, what Joseph had said. He said: "I will tell you the interpretation of this dream; just send me (to Joseph in prison)."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][46]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then he went to Joseph and said to him: "Joseph, O truthfulness incarnate, tell the true meaning of the dream in which seven fat cows are devoured by seven lean ones; and there are seven green ears of corn and seven others dry and withered so that I may return to the people and they may learn."
}

Thereupon the king asked the women: "What happened when you sought to tempt Joseph?" They said: "Allah forbid! We found no evil in him." The chief's wife said: "Now the truth has come to light. It was I who sought to tempt him. He is indeed truthful."

Joseph said: "I did this so that he [i.e. the chief) may know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that Allah does not allow the design of the treacherous to succeed.

I do not seek to acquit myself; for surely one's self prompts one to evil except him to whom my Lord may show mercy. Verily my Lord is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful."

The king said: "Bring him to me. I will select him exclusively for my own service." So when Joseph spoke to him the king said: "You are now one of established position, fully-trusted by us."

Joseph said: "Place me in charge of the treasures of the land. I am a good keeper and know my task well."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Thus did We establish Joseph in the land so that he could settle wherever he pleased. We bestow favour, out of Our Mercy, on whomsoever We please, and We do not cause the reward of those who do good to go to waste.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][57]

Surely the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and act in a God-fearing way.

And Joseph's brothers came to Egypt and presented themselves before him. He recognized them, but they did not know him.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][59]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when he had prepared for them their provisions, Joseph said: "Bring to me your other brother from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure and am most hospitable?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][60]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
If you do not bring him to me, you shall have no corn from me; and do not even attempt to come close to me."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][61]

\flushleft{
They said: "We will surely try to prevail over our father to send him. Be sure we shall do so."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][62]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Joseph said to his servants: "Put surreptitiously in their packs the goods they had given in exchange for corn." Joseph did so expecting that they would find it when they returned home. Feeling grateful for this generosity, they might be inclined to return to him.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][63]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When they returned to their father they said: "Father! We have been denied further supply of corn. So send with us our brother that we may bring the supplies. We shall be responsible for his protection."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][64]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The father said: "Shall I trust you with regard to him as I had trusted you earlier with regard to his brother? Allah is the Best Protector and is the Most Merciful."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][65]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when they opened their things they found that their goods had been given back to them. Thereupon they cried: "Father! What else would we desire? Look, even our goods have been given back to us, so we shall go now and bring supplies for our family, we shall protect our brother, and bring another camel-load of corn. That additional supply will be easily secured."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][66]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Their father said: "I shall never send him with you until you give me a solemn promise in the name of Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless you yourselves are surrounded." Then after they had given him their solemn promise, he said. "Allah watches over what we have said."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][67]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he enjoined them: "My sons! Do not enter the city by one gate; rather enter it by different gates. I can be of no help to you against Allah. Allah's command alone prevails. In Him have I put my trust and in Him should all those who have faith put their trust."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][68]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And it so happened that when they entered the city (by many gates) as their father had directed them, this precautionary measure proved ineffective against Allah's will. There was an uneasiness in Jacob's soul which he so tried to remove. Surely he was possessed of knowledge owing to the knowledge that We bestowed upon him. But most people do not know the truth of the matter.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][69]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When they presented themselves before Joseph, he took his brother aside to himself and said: "Verily I am your own brother Joseph; so do not grieve over the manner they have treated you."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][70]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then, while Joseph was having their provisions loaded, he put his drinking-cup in his brother's saddlebag. And then a herald cried: "Travellers, you are thieves."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][71]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Turning back they asked: "What have you lost?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][72]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The officials said: "We have lost the king's cup." (And their chief added): "He who brings it shall have a camel-load of provisions, I guarantee that."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][73]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said: "By Allah, you certainly know that we did not come to act corruptly in this land, nor are we those who steal."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The officials said: "If you are lying, what will be the penalty for him who has stolen?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They replied: "He in whose saddlebag the cup is found, he himself shall be its recompense." Thus do we punish the wrong-doers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][76]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then Joseph began searching their bags before searching his own brother's bag. Then he brought forth the drinking-cup from his brother's bag. Thus did We contrive to support Joseph. He had no right, according to the religion of the king (i.e. the law of Egypt), to take his brother, unless Allah so willed. We exalt whomsoever We will over others by several degrees. And above all those who know is the One Who truly knows.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][77]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said: "No wonder that he steals for a brother of his stole before." But Joseph kept his reaction to himself without disclosing the truth to them. He merely said to himself: "You are an evil lot. Allah knows well the truth of the accusation that you are making against me (to my face)."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said: "O powerful chief (al-aziz)! His father is an age-stricken man, (and in order that he may not suffer) seize one of us in his stead. We indeed consider you an excellent person."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][79]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Joseph said: "Allah forbid that we should seize any except him with whom we found our good. Were we to do so, we would surely be one of the wrong-doers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][80]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then, when they had despaired of Joseph they went to a corner and counselled together. The eldest of them said: "Do you not know that your father has taken a solemn promise from you in the name of Allah, and you failed in your duty towards Joseph? So I will not depart from this land until my father permits me, or Allah pronounces His judgement in my favour. He is the best of those who judge."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][81]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So go back to your father and tell him: "Father! Your son has certainly been guilty of stealing. We did not see him stealing but testify according to what we know, and obviously we had no power to keep watch over that what is altogether hidden from us.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][82]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
You may inquire of the dwellers of the city where we were, and of the people of the caravan with whom we travelled. We are altogether truthful in what we say."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][83]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The father heard the narration and said: "(All that is untrue). But your souls have made it easy for you to engage in a heinous act. So, I will be graciously patient even at this. Allah may well bring them all back to me. He is All-Knowing, All-Wise."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][84]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then he turned his back to them, and said: "O my grief for Joseph!" His eyes whitened with grief and he was choked up with sorrow trying to suppress his grief.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][85]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The sons said: "By Allah! You will continue to remember Joseph until you will either consume yourself with grief, or will die."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][86]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said: "I will address my sorrow and grief only to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][87]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
My sons! Go and try to find out about Joseph and his brother and do not despair of Allah's mercy. Verily only the unbelievers despair of Allah's mercy."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][88]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
On going to Egypt they presented themselves to Joseph and said to him: "O chief! We and our family are struck with distress and have brought only a paltry sum. So give us corn in full measure, and give it to us in charity. Allah rewards those who are charitable."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][89]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When Joseph heard this (he could not hold himself and said): "Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][90]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They exclaimed: "Are you indeed Joseph?" He said: "Yes, I am Joseph and this is my brother. Allah has surely been gracious to us. Indeed whoever fears Allah and remains patient, Allah does not allow the reward of such people to go to waste."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][91]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said: "We swear by Allah! Indeed Allah has chosen you in preference to us and we were truly guilty."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][92]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He replied: "No blame lies with you today. May Allah forgive you. He is the Most Merciful of all those that are merciful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][93]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Take this shirt of mine and throw it over my father's face. He will regain his sight. And bring to me all your family."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][94]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And as the caravan set out (from Egypt), their father said (in Canaan): "Indeed I smell the fragrance of Joseph. I say so although you may think that I am doting."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][95]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said: "Surely you are still in your same old craze."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][96]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when the bearer of good news came he threw Joseph's shirt over Jacob's face, whereupon he regained his sight, and said: "Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you do not know?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][97]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said: "Father! Pray for the forgiveness of our sins; we were truly guilty."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][98]

He said: "I shall pray to my Lord for your forgiveness, for He, and indeed He alone, is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][99]

And when they went to Joseph, he took his parents aside and said (to the members of his family): "Enter the city now, and if Allah wills, you shall be secure."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][100]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And after they had entered the city, Joseph raised his parents to the throne beside himself, and they (involuntarily) bowed in prostration before him. Joseph said: "Father! This is the fulfilment of the vision I had before - one that My Lord has caused to come true. He was kind to me when He rescued me from the prison, and brought you from the desert after Satan had stirred discord between me and my brothers. Certainly my Lord is Subtle in the fulfilment of His will; He is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

\flushleft{
Tell them plainly: "This is my way: I call you to Allah, on the basis of clear perception - both I and those who follow me. Allah - Glory be to Him - is free of every imperfection. I have nothing to do with those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity."

The Messengers whom We raised before you, (O Muhammad), and to whom We sent down revelations, were only human beings, and were from among those living in earthly habitations.

(It also happened with the earlier Messengers that for long they preached and people paid no heed) until the Messengers despaired of their people, and the people also fancied that they had been told lies (by the Messengers), then suddenly Our help came to the Messengers.

Certainly in the stories of the bygone people there is a lesson for people of understanding. What is being narrated in the Qur'an is no fabrication; it is rather confirmation of the Books that preceded it, and a detailed exposition of everything, and a guidance and mercy for people of faith.

Is it, then, in regard to Him Who watches over the deeds of every person that they are acting blasphemously by setting up His associates? Tell them: "Name those associates (if Allah Himself has made them His associates)! Or are you informing Allah of something the existence of which He does not even know?" Or do people arbitrarily utter empty words? Indeed, their foul contriving has been made to seem fair to the unbelievers and they have been barred from finding the Right Way.

\flushleft{
Never have We sent a Messenger but he has addressed his people in their language that he may fully expound his Message to them. (And after the Message is expounded), Allah lets go astray whomsoever He wills, and guides to the Right Way whomsoever He wills. He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.

And call to mind when Moses said to his people: "Remember Allah's favour upon you when He delivered you from Pharaoh's people who afflicted you with a grievous chastisement, slaughtering your sons, while letting your women live. In it there was a terrible trial from your Lord."

Have the accounts of your predecessors not reached you: the people of Noah, the Ad, the Thamud, and those who came after them - they whose number is not known to any except Allah? Their Messengers came to them with Clear Signs, but they thrust their hands in their mouths, and said: "We do surely reject the Message you have brought, and we are in disquieting doubt about what you are summoning us to."
}

Their Messengers said: "Can there be any doubt about Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He invites you that He may forgive you your sins and grant you respite till an appointed term."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[14][11]

Their Messengers told them: "Indeed we are only human beings like yourselves, but Allah bestows His favour on those of His servants whom He wills. It does not lie in our power to produce any authority except by the leave of Allah. It is in Allah that the believers should put their trust.

Then the unbelievers told their Messengers: "You will have to return to the fold of our faith or else we shall banish you from our land." Thereupon their Lord revealed to them: "We will most certainly destroy these wrong-doers,

Then all of them will appear exposed before Allah, and the weak ones will say to the haughty ones: "We merely followed you. Will you, then, protect us from Allah's chastisement?"

(O Muhammad), are they waiting for anything else than that the angels should appear before them, or that your Lord's judgement should come? Many before them acted with similar temerity. And then what happened with them was not Allah's wrong-doing; they rather wronged themselves.

Those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity say: "Were Allah to will so, neither we nor our forefathers would have worshipped any other than Him, nor would we have prohibited anything without His command."

Had you seen them in the Cave it would have appeared to you that when the sun rose, it moved away from their Cave to the right; and when it set, it turned away from them to the left, while they remained in a spacious hollow in the Cave.

Thus did We make their case known to the people of the city so that they might know that Allah's promise is true, and that there is absolutely no doubt that the Hour will come to pass.

Pharaoh said: "What! Did you believe in Him even before I permitted you to do so? Surely, he must be your chief who taught you magic.

The magicians answered: "By Him Who has created us, we shall never prefer you to the Truth after manifest Signs have come to us. So decree whatever you will. Your decree will pertain, at the most, to the present life of the world.

Most certainly We revealed to Moses: "Proceed with My servants in the night and strike for them a dry path in the sea. Have no fear of being overtaken, nor be afraid of treading through the sea."

Moses returned to his people full of wrath and grief, and said: "My people! Has your Lord not made good an excellent promise He made to you? And has a long time passed since those promises were fulfilled? Or was it to incur the wrath of your Lord that you broke your promise with me?"

Most certainly We had given Adam a command before, but he forgot. We found him lacking in firmness of resolution.

Recall when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves before Adam"; all prostrated themselves save Iblis. He refused.

\flushleft{
Then We said: "Adam! He is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not drive both of you out of Paradise and plunge you into affliction,

Then the two of them ate the fruit of that tree and their shameful parts became revealed to each other, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves from the Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord and strayed into error.

O mankind! If you have any doubt concerning Resurrection, then know that it is surely We Who created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, then from a clot of blood, then from a little lump of flesh, some of it shapely and other shapeless.

We bring you forth as infants (and nurture you) that you may come of age. Among you is he that dies (at a young age) and he who is kept back to the most abject age so that after once having known, he reaches a stage when he knows nothing. You see the earth dry and barren and then no sooner than We send down water upon it, it begins to quiver and swell and brings forth every kind of beauteous vegetation.

\flushleft{
Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you (O Muhammad), but that whenever he had a desire, Satan interfered with that desire. Allah eradicates the interference of Satan and strengthens His Signs. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[22][53]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(He does this) in order that He may make the evil caused by Satan a trial for those in whose hearts there is sickness (of hypocrisy), whose hearts are hard (and vitiated). Surely these wrong-doers have gone too far in their dissension.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[22][54]

(He also does this) in order that those endowed with knowledge may know that it is the Truth from your Lord and that they may have faith in it and their hearts may humble themselves before Him. Verily Allah always directs those that believe to the Right Way.

That indeed is so, as for him who retaliates in proportion to the excess committed against him, and is thereafter again subjected to transgression, Allah will surely aid him. Verily Allah is All-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.

Instead of Allah they worship those concerning whom He has revealed no sanction and concerning whom they have no true knowledge. None shall be able to help such evil-doers.

\flushleft{
When Our Signs are plainly recited to them, you will perceive utter repugnance on their faces and it all but seems as if they will soon pounce upon those who recite Our Signs to them.

O people, a parable is set forth: pay heed to it. Those who call upon aught other than Allah shall never be able to create even a fly, even if all of them were to come together to do that.

Strive in the cause of Allah in a manner worthy of that striving. He has chosen you (for His task), and He has not laid upon you any hardship in religion. Keep to the faith of your father Abraham. Allah named you Muslims earlier and even in this (Book), that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that you may be witnesses over all mankind. So establish Prayer, and pay Zakah, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protector. What an excellent Protector; what an excellent Helper!

We created man out of the extract of clay,

then We made him into a drop of life-germ, then We placed it in a safe depository,

\quranayah[23][14]

\flushleft{
then We made this drop into a clot, then We made the clot into a lump, then We made the lump into bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We caused it to grow into another creation. Thus Most Blessed is Allah, the Best of all those that create.

Thereafter you are destined to die,

But the notables among his people had refused to believe, and said: "This is none other than a mortal like yourselves who desires to attain superiority over you.

Thereupon We revealed to him, saying: "Build the Ark under Our eyes and according to Our revelation.

Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Whenever a Messenger came to his people they rejected him, calling him a liar. Thereupon, We made each people to follow the other (to its doom), reducing them to mere tales (of the past). Scourged be the people who do not believe!

And We gave Moses the Book that people might be guided by it.

\flushleft{
Pharaoh said: "You accepted the word of Moses even before I granted you the leave to do so. Surely he is your chief who has taught you magic. Soon shall you come to know. I shall cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and shall crucify all of you."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][50]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said: "We do not care, for we are bound to return to our Lord,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][51]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and we surely expect that Our Lord will forgive us our sins for we are the first ones to believe."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][52]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We revealed to Moses: "Set forth with My servants by night for you will be pursued."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][53]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities (to mobilise troops)
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][54]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
saying: "These (Israelites) are only a small band of people
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][55]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
who have certainly provoked our wrath.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][56]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But we are a numerous host, ever on guard."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][57]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thus did We drive them out of their gardens and springs
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][58]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and their treasures and excellent dwellings.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][59]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
This happened with them; (but on the other hand), We enabled the Children of Israel to inherit those bounties.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][60]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
At sunrise they set off in pursuit of them
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][61]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and when the groups came face to face, the companions of Moses cried out: "We are overtaken!"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][62]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Moses said: "Certainly not. My Lord is with me; He will direct me."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][63]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We revealed to Moses, (commanding him): "Strike the sea with your rod." Thereupon the sea split up, and then each became like the mass of a huge mount.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][64]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We also brought the other party close to the same spot,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][65]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and We delivered Moses and his companions, all of them,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][66]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
then We drowned the others.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][67]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Surely there is a Sign in this, but most of them would not believe.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Verily your Lord is Immensely Mighty, Ever Compassionate.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
And recount to them the story of Abraham:
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][70]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
when he asked his father and his people: "What do you worship?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][71]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They answered: "There are some idols that we worship and are devoted to them with constancy."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][72]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He asked: "Do they hear you when you call them
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][73]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
or do they cause you any benefit or harm?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They answered: "No; but we found our forefathers doing so."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thereupon, Abraham said: "Have you seen (with your eyes) those whom you have been worshipping,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][76]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
you and your forefathers of yore?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][77]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They are all enemies to me; all, except the Lord of the Universe
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Who created me and Who guides me;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][79]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Who gives me food and drink,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][80]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and Who, when I am ill, heals me;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][81]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Who will cause me to die and then will again restore me to life;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][82]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Who, I hope, will forgive me my sins on the Day of Judgement."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][83]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(And then Abraham prayed): "My Lord, endow me with knowledge and wisdom and join me with the righteous,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][84]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and grant me an honourable reputation among posterity,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][85]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and make me of those who will inherit the Garden of Bliss,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][86]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and forgive my father for he is among those who strayed,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][87]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and disgrace me not on the Day when people will be raised to life,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][88]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
the Day when nothing will avail, neither wealth nor offspring,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][89]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
but only he that brings to Allah a sound heart will (attain to success)."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][90]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(On that Day) the Garden will be brought near to the God-fearing,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][91]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and the Fire will be uncovered for those who strayed,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][92]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and they will be asked: "Where are the gods that you worshipped
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][93]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
beside Allah? Can they be of any help to you, or even be of any help to themselves?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][94]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then the idols and those who strayed will be hurled into the Fire headlong, one upon another,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][95]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and so too the hosts of Iblis, all of them.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][96]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
There they will quarrel with one another and the erring ones will say (to their deities):

\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
"By Allah, we were surely in clear error
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
when we assigned to you a position equal to that of the Lord of the Universe.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][99]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
It is none but those steeped in guilt who led us into this error,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][100]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and now we have none to intercede on our behalf,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][101]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
nor do we have a truly sincere friend.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][102]

\flushleft{
If only we could return we would be among the believers."
}

The people of Noah gave the lie to the Messengers.

So fear Allah and obey me."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

They answered: "Shall we accept you even though it is the meanest of people who follow you?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][112]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Noah said: "What knowledge do I have about their deeds?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][113]

\flushleft{
It is only for my Lord to take account of them. Would that you made use of your understanding!
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][114]

\flushleft{
It is not for me to repel those who choose to believe.

\flushleft{
I am none but a plain warner."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

They said: "O Noah! If you do not desist, you will certainly become one of the accursed."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][117]

\flushleft{
He said: "My Lord! My people have branded me a liar.

So pass a clear judgement between me and them and rescue me and the believers with me."

\flushleft{
Thereafter We rescued him and those who were with him in the laden Ark

Do they really want Our chastisement to be expedited?

Did you consider that if We were to let them enjoy life for many years

As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have made their deeds seem attractive to them so they stumble around in perplexity.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][5]

\flushleft{
It is they for whom a grievous chastisement lies in store; it is they who shall be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.

As for you, (O Muhammad), you are receiving the Qur'an from the Most Wise, the All-Knowing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][7]

\flushleft{
(Recount to them) when Moses said to his family: "I perceive something like fire: soon will I bring to you some information from there, or I will bring you a burning brand that you may warm yourselves."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][8]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But when Moses came to the fire, a call was sounded: "Blessed is He Who is in the fire and whatever is around it. Glory be to Allah, the Sustainer of all in the Universe.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][9]

Now cast your rod!" But when he saw the rod writhing as though it were a serpent, he turned his back in retreat and did not even look behind. "O Moses, have no fear. Messengers have no fear in My presence,

\quranayah[27][11]

Now put your hand into your bosom, and it will come forth shining without any blemish. (These are two of the) nine Signs to be carried to Pharaoh and his people. They are surely a wicked people."

\flushleft{
But when Our Clear Signs came to them, they said: "This is plain magic."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][14]

\flushleft{
They denied those Signs out of iniquity and arrogance although their hearts were convinced of their truth. So see how evil was the end of those mischief-makers!

(On the other hand), We granted knowledge to David and Solomon and they said: "All praise be to Allah Who has exalted us above many of His believing servants!"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][16]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Solomon succeeded David and said: "O people, we have been taught the speech of birds and we have been endowed with all kinds of things. Surely this is a conspicuous favour (from Allah)."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][17]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Hosts of jinn and humans and birds were marshalled for Solomon and were kept under full control.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(Solomon was once on the move with them) until when they reached a valley of ants one of the ants said: "O ants, get into your holes, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under their feet) without even knowing."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Smiling at the ant's utterance, Solomon burst into laughter and said: "My Lord! Hold me under (Your) control that I may render thanks for the favour which You have bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may act righteously in a manner that would please You. Include me, out of Your Mercy, among Your righteous servants."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(On another occasion) Solomon inspected the birds and said: "Why is it that I do not see the hoopoe? Is he among the absentees?

Not before long the hoopoe came up and said: "I have obtained a knowledge which you could not. I have brought for you sure news about Sheba.

I found there a woman ruling over them, one who has been endowed with all things and has a mighty throne.

I found that she and her people prostrate themselves before the sun rather than Allah. " Satan has made their deeds appear attractive to them and has, thus, debarred them from the Right Path so they do not find true guidance

Take this letter of mine, deliver it to them, and then draw back from them, and observe what they do."

\flushleft{
The Queen said:" Know my nobles that a gracious letter has been delivered to me.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][30]

\flushleft{
It is from Solomon, and it is: "In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate."

(It says): "Do not act towards me with defiance, but come to me in submission."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

(After reading the letter) the Queen said: "Nobles, let me have your counsel in this matter for I make no firm decision without you."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][33]

\flushleft{
They said: "We are strong and are given to vehement fighting. But the decision is yours. Therefore, consider what you would like to command."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][34]

\flushleft{
The Queen said: "When the kings enter a country they cause corruption in it and abase those of its people who are held in honour. This is what they are wont to do.

\flushleft{
I will send them a gift and then see with what answer my envoys return."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Now, when (the envoy of the Queen) came to Solomon, he said: "Do you want to aid me with wealth? Whatever Allah has granted me is much more than what He has given you. (Keep for yourselves) your gift in which you are exulting.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][37]

\flushleft{
Envoy, go back to those who sent you and we shall certainly come upon them with hosts whom they will be unable to resist. We shall drive them out from there, and they will suffer humiliation and disgrace."

Solomon said: "My nobles, which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?"

A stalwart of the jinn said: "I will bring it to you before you rise from your council. Surely I have the power to do so and I am trustworthy."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][40]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he who had some knowledge of the Book said: "I will bring it before the twinkling of your eye." When Solomon saw the throne placed firmly beside him, he cried out: "This is by the grace of my Lord so that He may test me whether I give thanks for (His Bounty) or act with ingratitude. Whoever is grateful is so to his own good; and whoever is ungrateful, let him know that my Lord is Immensely Resourceful, Most Bountiful."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Solomon said: " Set the throne before her casually, and let us see whether she gets to the Truth or is one of those who are not guided to what is right."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When the Queen arrived, she was asked: "Is your throne like this one?" She said: "It seems as if it is the same. We had already come to know this and we had submitted ourselves."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
What prevented her (from accepting the True Faith) was her worshipping deities other than Allah, for she belonged to an unbelieving people.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
She was told: "Enter the palace." But when she saw it, she thought it was a pool of water and she bared both her calves (to enter into it). Solomon said: "This is a slippery floor of crystal." Thereupon she cried out: "My Lord, I have been inflicting much wrong on myself. Now I submit myself with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the whole Universe."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][45]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We sent to Thamud their brother Salih (with the Message): "Serve Allah," but all of a sudden they became split into two quarrelling factions.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][46]

\flushleft{
Salih said: "My people, why do you wish to hasten that evil rather than good should come upon you? Why should you not seek pardon from Allah so that mercy be shown to you?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][47]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said: "We augur ill of you and those who are with you." Salih replied: "Your augury is with Allah. The truth is that you are a people who are being tried."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][48]

\flushleft{
Now there were nine ring-leaders in the city who created corruption in the land and never worked to set things right.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][49]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said: "Swear to one another in the name of Allah that we shall make a sudden night swoop on Salih and his family and will then tell their heirs that we did not witness the destruction of his family. We are indeed truthful."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][50]

\flushleft{
Thus they planned and We too planned, the while they did not know.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][51]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So see what was the outcome of the plan they made: We utterly destroyed them and their people, all of them.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][52]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Now behold their houses that lie in utter ruins because of their wrong-doing. Verily there is a Sign in this for the people who know.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

And We delivered those who believed and were wont to avoid disobeying (Allah).

We also sent Lot, and recall when he told his people: "Do you commit shameless acts with your eyes open?

Do you lustfully approach men instead of women? Nay, you engage in acts of sheer ignorance."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

But this had only one answer from his people. They said: "Expel Lot's folk from your city. They pretend to be absolutely clean."

Eventually We saved (Lot) and his family, except his wife. We had decreed that she should be among those who would remain behind.

\flushleft{
These are the verses of the Clear Book.

\flushleft{
We recount to you with truth some parts of the story of Moses and Pharaoh for the benefit of those who believe.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][4]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed Pharaoh transgressed in the land and divided its people into sections. One group of them he humiliated, and slew their sons and spared their daughters. Truly he was among the mischief-makers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][5]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We wanted to bestow favour on those who were oppressed in the land. We wanted to make them leaders and heirs
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][6]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and to grant them power in the land, and make Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts see what they had feared.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][7]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We suggested to the mother of Moses: "Suckle your child, but when you fear for his life cast him into the river and be not fearful nor grieve, for We shall restore him to you and make him one of the Messengers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][8]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then Pharaoh's household picked him up (from the river) that he may be their adversary and be a cause of sorrow to them. Surely Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts erred (in their scheming).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][9]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The wife of Pharaoh said: "Here is a delight of the eye to me and to you. Do not kill him. Maybe he will prove useful for us, or we may adopt him as a son." They were unaware of the end of it all.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][10]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
On the other hand, the heart of Moses' mother was sorely distressed. Had We not strengthened her heart that she might have full faith (in Our promise), she would have disclosed the secret.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][11]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
She told the sister of Moses: "Follow him." So she kept watch over him unperceived (by the enemies).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][12]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We had already forbidden the breasts of the nurses for the child. (So seeing the girl) said: "Shall I direct you to the people of a household that will rear him with utter sincerity?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][13]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thus did We restore Moses to his mother that her eyes might be comforted and she might not grieve, and realise that the promise of Allah was true. But most people are unaware of this.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][14]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When Moses reached the age of full youth and grew to maturity, We bestowed upon him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We reward those who do good.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][15]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Once he entered the city at a time when its people were heedless, and he encountered two men fighting, one of whom belonged to his own people and the other to his foes. Now the man belonging to Moses' own people cried out to him for help against the man from the foes, and Moses struck him with his fist and finished him. Moses said: "This is an act of Satan. Surely he is an enemy who openly misleads."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][16]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then he prayed: "My Lord! I have indeed inflicted wrong on myself, so do forgive me," wherefore Allah forgave him for He is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][17]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thereupon Moses vowed: "My Lord, because of the favour that You have done me I shall never support the guilty."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The next morning he proceeded to the city in fear and looking around as one apprehensive of danger when all of a sudden, the man who had sought his help the day before again called out to him for his help. Moses said to him: "Clearly, you are a very misguided fellow."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when Moses decided to lay his violent hands on the man belonging to the enemy, he cried out: "Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed a person yesterday?" You simply want to live in the land as a tyrant, and do not wish to set things right."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then a man came running from the farther end of the city and said: "O Moses, the nobles are deliberating about you that they may put you to death. So do be gone. I am one of your well-wishers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][21]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Soon after hearing this Moses departed in a state of fear, looking around as one in apprehension and prayed: "My Lord, deliver me from these unjust people."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When (after his departure from Egypt) Moses headed towards Midian, he said: "I hope my Lord will show me the right Path."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][23]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When he arrived at the spring of Midian, he found there a crowd of people watering their flocks, and he found apart from them two women holding their flocks back. He asked the women: "What is it that troubles you?" They said: "We cannot water our flocks until the shepherds take their flocks away, and our father is a very old man."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][24]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
On hearing this Moses watered their flocks for them, and then returned in a shaded place and said: "My Lord, I am truly in great need of any good that You might send down to me."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][25]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Soon thereafter one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully, and said: "My father invites you that he may reward you for your having watered our flocks for us. " When Moses came to him and narrated to him the whole of his story, he said: "Have no fear. You are now safe from the iniquitous people."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][26]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
One of the two women said: "Father, employ this man in your service. The best whom you might employ is he who is strong and trustworthy."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][27]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Her father said to Moses: "I want to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you if you serve me for eight years. But if you complete ten years, that will be of your own accord (but not an obligation). I do not intend to treat you harshly. If Allah wills, you will find me an upright man."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][28]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Moses replied: "So that is agreed between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, I trust that I shall not be wronged. Allah is a witness over the covenant we are committing ourselves to."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When Moses had fulfilled the term and was journeying with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of the Mount (Sinai). He said to his family: "Wait here; I have observed a fire. Maybe I will bring to you some news or a brand of fire from there that you may warm yourselves."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][30]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But when he came to the fire, a cry was heard from the right bank of the valley, from a tree in the hallowed ground: "O Moses, verily I am Allah, the Lord of all creatures of the Universe."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He received the command: "Throw away your rod!" But when he saw the rod writhing as though it were a serpent, he turned back in retreat, and did not even look behind. (He was told): "O Moses, go ahead and have no fear. You are perfectly secure.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Put your hand into your bosom, and it will come out shining without any blemish; and draw your hand close to your body to still your fear. Those are the two clear Signs from your Lord for Pharaoh and his chiefs, for truly they are a disobedient people."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Moses said: "My Lord, I have killed one person from among them, and I fear that they will kill me.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][34]

\flushleft{
My brother Aaron is more eloquent in speech than I: so send him with me as a helper to confirm my truthfulness for I fear that they will reject me as a liar."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][35]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said: "We will certainly strengthen you through your brother and will invest both of you with such power that they shall not be able to hurt you. With the help of Our Signs the two of you and your followers will prevail."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But when Moses came to them with Our Clear Signs, they said: "This is nothing but a magic that has been contrived. We never heard anything like it from our ancestors of yore."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Moses replied: "My Lord knows best who comes with guidance from Him, and also whose end will be the best in the Hereafter. As for the wrongdoers, they shall not prosper."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Pharaoh said: "O nobles, I do not know that you have any god beside myself. Haman, bake bricks out of clay and build a lofty palace for me so that I may mount up and be able to observe the god of Moses, even though I believe that Moses is a liar."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][39]

\flushleft{
And he and his hosts waxed arrogant in the land without any right, believing that they will never have to return to Us!
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][40]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Eventually We seized him and his hosts and We flung them into the sea. So do see the end of the wrong-doers!
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][41]

\flushleft{
And We made them leaders who invite people to the Fire. On the Day of Judgement they shall not find help from any quarter.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

We have made a curse to pursue them in this world, and on the Day of Judgement they shall be among the despised.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
After We had destroyed the earlier generations We bestowed the Book on Moses - a source of enlightenment for people and a guidance and mercy -- that they may take heed.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(O Muhammad), you were then not on the western side when We bestowed this commandment (of Law), and you were not among its witnesses.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][45]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thereafter We raised up many a generation and a long time passed. You were then not even present among the people of Midian to rehearse Our verses to them. But it is We Who are sending news about that.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][46]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Nor were you on the side of the Mount (Sinai) when We called out to Moses (in the first instance). But it is out of Mercy from your Lord (that you are being informed of all this) so that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you. Maybe they will take heed.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][47]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(We did so) lest a calamity might seize them because of the misdeeds they committed whereafter they would say: "Our Lord, why did you not send a Messenger to us that we follow Your revelation and become among those who believe?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][48]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But when the Truth reached them from Us, they said: "Why was he not given that which was given to Moses?" But did they not reject before what had been given to Moses? They said: "Both are magic, each supporting the other!" And they said: "We deny each of these."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][49]

\flushleft{
Tell them, (O Prophet): "Then do bring a Book from Allah which is a better guide than either of them, and I will follow it! Do so if you are truthful!"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][50]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But if they do not hearken to this, know well that they only follow their lusts and who is in greater error than he who follows his lusts without any guidance from Allah? Allah does not guide those given to wrong-doing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][51]

\flushleft{
We have constantly conveyed them the word (of admonition) that they may take heed.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Those on whom We bestowed the Book before do believe in this (to wit, the Qur'an).

When it is recited to them they say: "We believe in it for it is the Truth from our Lord. Indeed we were already Muslims."

\flushleft{
These will be granted their reward twice over because they remained steadfast; they repel evil with good, and spend (in alms) out of the sustenance We provided them,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][55]

\flushleft{
and when they hear any vain talk, they turn away from it, saying: "We have our deeds and you have your deeds. Peace be to you. We do not desire to act like the ignorant."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][56]

(O Prophet), you cannot grant guidance to whom you please. It is Allah Who guides those whom He will. He knows best who are amenable to guidance.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][57]

\flushleft{
They say: "If we were to follow this guidance with you, we should be snatched away from our land." Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary to which fruits of all kinds are brought as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know.

And how many a town did We destroy whose inhabitants exulted on account of their affluence. These are their dwellings in which very few dwelt after them. Eventually it is We Who inherited them.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][59]

Your Lord would not destroy a town until He had sent to its centre a Messenger who would recite to them Our verses. Nor would We destroy any town unless its inhabitants were iniquitous.

Whatever you have been given is a provision for the life of this world and its glitter. But that which is with Allah is better and more enduring. Do you not use your intellect?

\flushleft{
Now, he to whom We have promised a good which he is going to obtain - can he be like him whom We have given the good things of this life, but who will be brought up for punishment on the Day of Judgement?

(Let them not forget) that the Day when Allah will call unto them, and say: "Where are those whom you imagined to be My associates?"

\flushleft{
Those against whom the Word will be realised will say: "Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray just as we ourselves strayed. We absolve ourselves before You of all blame. It was not us that they worshipped."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][64]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will then be told: "Call upon those for help whom you declared to be Our associates." They will then call upon them but they will not answer them. They will have observed the chastisement in front of them. Would that they were guided!

Then they will not be able to think of any reply, nor will they be able to ask one another.

To be sure, Qarun (Korah) was one of Moses' people; then he transgressed against them. We had bestowed on him such treasure that their very keys would have been raised with difficulty by a whole group of strong people.

Seek by means of the wealth that Allah has granted you the Abode of the Hereafter, but forget not your share in this world and do good as Allah has been good to you and do not strive to create mischief in the land, for Allah loves not those who create mischief."

He replied: "All this has been given to me on account of a certain knowledge that I have." Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him those who were stronger in might than he and were more numerous in multitude? The wicked are not asked about their acts of sin.

Once Korah went forth among his people in full glitter. Those seeking the life of this world said: "Would that we had the like of what Korah has! He truly has a great fortune."

At last We caused the earth to swallow him and his house. Thereafter there was no group of people that could come to his aid against Allah; nor was he able to come to his own aid.

And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow: "Alas, we had forgotten that it is Allah Who increases the provision of those of His servants whom He will and grants in sparing measure to those whom He will.

They disbelieved in it before and indulged in conjectures from far away.

A barrier will be placed between them and what they desire, as was done with the likes of them before. Surely they were in a disquieting doubt.

All praise be to Allah, the Fashioner of the heavens and earth, Who appointed angels as His message bearers, having two, three, four wings. He adds to His creation whatever He pleases. Verily Allah has power over everything.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][2]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Whatever Mercy Allah accords to people, none can withhold; and whatever He withholds, no other will be able to release after Him. He is Most Mighty, Most Wise.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][3]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
O people, remember Allah's favour upon you. Is there any creator, apart from Allah, who provides you your sustenance out of the heavens and earth? There is no god but He. Whither are you, then, being misdirected?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][4]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(O Prophet), (there is nothing novel in it) if they cry lies to you; Messengers before you were also cried lies to. To Allah shall all matters be sent back.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][5]

\flushleft{
O people, assuredly Allah's promise is true. So let the life of the world not delude you, and let not the Deluder delude you concerning Allah.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][6]

Surely Satan is an enemy to you. Therefore, do take him as an enemy. He calls his followers to his way so that they may be among the inmates of the Fire.

A severe chastisement lies in store for those that disbelieve, but there is pardon and a great reward for those that believe and work righteous deeds.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][8]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(How awful is the straying of the person) for whom his evil deed has been embellished so that it looks fair to him? The fact is that Allah causes whomsoever He will to fall into error and shows the Right Way to whomsoever He will. So, (O Prophet), let not your life go to waste sorrowing over them. Allah is well aware of all that they do.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][9]

It is Allah Who sends forth winds which then set the clouds in motion, which We drive to some dead land giving a fresh life to earth after it had become dead. Such will be the resurrection of the dead.

\quranayah[35][10]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He who seeks glory, let him know that all glory belongs to Allah alone. To Him do good words go up, and righteous action uplifts them. But those who contrive evil deeds, a severe punishment lies in store for them, and their contriving will come to naught.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][11]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Allah created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, then He made you into pairs. No female conceives, nor delivers (a child) except with His knowledge. None is given a long life nor is any diminished in his life but it is written in a Book. Surely that is quite easy for Allah.

\flushleft{
The two masses of water are not alike. The one is sweet, sates thirst, and is pleasant to drink from, while the other is salt, bitter on the tongue. Yet from both you eat fresh meat, and extract from it ornaments that you wear; and you see ships cruising through it that you may seek of His Bounty and be thankful to Him.

\quranayah[35][13]

\flushleft{
He causes the night to phase into the day and the day into the night, and He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running its course to an appointed term.

If you call upon them, they cannot hear your prayer. And if they hear it, they cannot answer it. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown you for associating others with Allah in His Divinity. No one can inform you of the truth save the All-Aware.

If He wishes, He can remove you and put in your place a new creation.

That surely is not difficult for Allah.

\flushleft{
No one can bear another's burden. If a heavily laden one should call another to carry his load, none of it shall be carried by the other, even though he be a near of kin. (O Prophet), you can warn only those who fear their Lord without seeing Him and establish Prayer. Whoever purifies himself does so to his own good. To Allah is the final return.

You are no more than a warner.

and human beings too, and beasts, and cattle -- diverse are their hues. From among His servants, it is only those who know that fear Allah. Verily Allah is Most Mighty, Most Forgiving.

Surely those who recite the Book of Allah and establish Prayer and spend, privately and publicly, out of what We have provided them, look forward to a trade that shall suffer no loss;

Then We bequeathed the Book to those of Our servants that We chose. Now, some of them wrong themselves and some follow the medium course; and some, by Allah's leave, vie with each other in acts of goodness. That is the great bounty.

They shall enter the everlasting Gardens, shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and their apparel therein shall be silk.

They will say: “All praise be to Allah Who has taken away all sorrow from us. Surely our Lord is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciative;

As for those who disbelieved, the Fire of Hell awaits them. There they shall not be finished off and die; nor will the torment (of Hell) be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every thankless being.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will cry out in Hell and say: “Our Lord, let us out so that we may act righteously, different from what we did before.” (They will be told): “Did we not grant you an age long enough for anyone to take heed if he had wanted to take heed? Besides, there came a warner to you. So have a taste of the torment now. None may come to the help of the wrong-doers.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][38]

Surely Allah knows the Unseen in the heavens and the earth. He even knows the secrets hidden in people's breasts.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][39]

\flushleft{
It is He Who made you vicegerents in the earth. So whoever disbelieves will bear the burden of his unbelief. The unbelievers' unbelief adds nothing but Allah's wrath against them. The unbelievers' unbelief adds nothing but their own loss.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][40]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Say to them (O Prophet): “Have you ever seen those of your associates upon whom you call apart from Allah? Show me what have they created in the earth? Or do they have any partnership (with Allah) in the heavens? Or have We given them a Book so that they have a clear proof (for associating others with Allah in His Divinity)?” Nay, what these wrong-doers promise each other is nothing but delusion.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Surely Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest they should be displaced there, for if they were displaced none would be able to hold them after Him. Surely He is Most Forbearing, Most Forgiving.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Swearing by Allah their strongest oaths they claimed that if a warner came to them they would be better-guided than any other people. But when a warner did come to them, his coming only increased their aversion (to the Truth).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They began to wax even more proud on earth and contrived evil designs although the contriving of evil designs only overtakes their authors. Are they waiting, then, for anything except what happened to the nations before them? You shall not find any change in the Way of Allah; and you shall not find anything that can ever alter the Way of Allah.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Have they not journeyed in the earth to behold the end of those who went before them though they were stronger than them in might? Nothing in the heavens nor on earth can frustrate Him in the least. He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[35][45]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
If Allah were to take people to task for their deeds, He would not leave any living creature on earth, but He grants them respite to an appointed time. When their appointed time comes to an end, surely Allah fully observes His servants.

It is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them for they shall not believe.

You can warn only him who follows the Admonition and fears the Merciful Lord without seeing Him. Give such a one good tidings of forgiveness and a generous reward.

Recite to them, as a case in point, the story of the people of the town when the Messengers came to them.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][14]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We sent to them two Messengers and they rejected both of them as liars. Then We strengthened them with a third (Messenger).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][15]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said: “We have been sent to you as Messengers.” The people of the town said: “You are only human beings like ourselves, and the Merciful Lord has revealed nothing. You are simply lying.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][16]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The Messengers said: “Our Lord knows that we have indeed been sent to you
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][17]

\flushleft{
and our duty is no more than to clearly convey the Message.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The people of the town said: “We believe you are an evil omen for us. If you do not desist, we will stone you or you will receive a grievous chastisement from us.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The Messengers replied: “Your evil omen is with you. (Are you saying this) because you were asked to take heed? The truth is that you are a people who have exceeded all bounds.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
In the meantime a man came running from the far end of the town, saying: “My people, follow the Messengers;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][21]

\flushleft{
follow those who do not ask any recompense from you and are rightly-guided.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][22]

Why should I not serve the One Who created me and to Whom all of you shall be sent back?

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][23]

\flushleft{
What! Shall I take any deities apart from Him whose intercession will not avail me the least were the Merciful One to bring any adversity upon me, nor will they be able to rescue me?

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][24]

Surely in that case I should indeed be in evident error.

(Eventually they killed him and he was told): “Enter Paradise.” The man exclaimed: “Would that my people knew

All of them shall (one day) be gathered before Us.

Let the dead earth be a Sign for them. We gave it life and produced from it grain whereof they eat.

We made in it gardens of date-palms and vines, and We caused springs to gush forth

that they might eat of its fruits. It was not their hands that made them. Will they not, then, give thanks?

Holy is He Who created all things in pairs, whether it be of what the earth produces, and of themselves, and of what they do not know.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

And the night is another Sign for them. We strip the day from it and they become plunged in darkness.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][38]

\flushleft{
The sun is running its course to its appointed place. That is the ordaining of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.

We have appointed stages for the moon till it returns in the shape of a dry old branch of palm-tree.

Neither does it lie in the sun's power to overtake the moon nor can the night outstrip the day. All glide along, each in its own orbit.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Another Sign for them is that We carried all their offspring in the laden vessel
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and then created for them other vessels like those on which they ride.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Should We so wish, We can drown them, and there will be none to heed their cries of distress, nor will they be rescued.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][44]

\flushleft{
It is only Our Mercy (that rescues them) and enables enjoyment of life for a while.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][45]

When it is said to such people: “Guard yourselves against what is ahead of you and what has preceded you that mercy be shown to you” (they pay scant heed to it).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][46]

\flushleft{
Never does any Sign of their Lord come to them, but they turn away from it.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][47]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when it is said to them: “Spend (in the Way of Allah) out of the sustenance that Allah has provided you,” the unbelievers say to the believers: “Shall we feed him whom, Allah would have fed, had He so wished?” Say: “You are in evident error.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][48]

The Truth is that they are waiting for nothing but a mighty Blast to seize them the while they are disputing (in their worldly affairs),

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][50]

\flushleft{
and they will not even be able to make a testament, nor to return to their households.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][51]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then the Trumpet shall be blown and lo! they will come out of their graves and be on the move towards their Lord,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][52]

\flushleft{
(nervously) exclaiming. “Alas for us! Who roused us out of our sleeping-place?” “This is what the Merciful One had promised, and what (His) Messengers had said was true.”

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][53]

Then there will simply be one single Blast, and all will have gathered before Us.

Today no one shall suffer the least injustice, and you shall not be recompensed except according to your deeds.

Indeed, the people of Paradise will be busy enjoying themselves:

Whomsoever We grant a long life, We reverse him in his constitution. Do they still not understand?

\flushleft{
We did not teach him (to wit, the Messenger) poetry and it does not behove him. This is none but an Admonition, and a Clear Book

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][70]

that he may warn him who is alive and establish an argument against those that deny the Truth.

\flushleft{
Do they not see Our handiwork: We created for them cattle which they own?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][72]

\flushleft{
We have subjected the cattle to them so that some of them they ride and eat the flesh of others.

They derive a variety of benefits and drinks from them. Will they, then, not give thanks?

They set up deities apart from Allah, hoping that they will receive help from them.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][75]

\flushleft{
Those deities can render them no help. Yet these devotees act as though they were an army in waiting for them.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][76]

\flushleft{
Let not their words grieve you. Surely We know all things about them, what they conceal and what they reveal.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][77]

Does man not see that We created him of a sperm drop, and lo! he is flagrantly contentious?

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][78]

He strikes for Us a similitude and forgot his own creation. He says: “Who will quicken the bones when they have decayed?”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][79]

Say: “He Who first brought them into being will quicken them; He knows well about every kind of creation;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][80]

\flushleft{
He Who created from a green tree a fire for you, a fire to light your stoves with.”

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][81]

Has He Who created the heavens and the earth no power to create the likes of them? Yes, indeed, He is the Superb Creator.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][82]

Whenever He wills a thing, He just commands it “Be” and it is.

\flushleft{
by those who reprove severely,

and those who recite the Exhortation;

\flushleft{
surely your God is One,

the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of whatever lies between the two, the Lord of the Easts.

We have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars

and have protected it from every rebellious satan.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][8]

These satans cannot listen to what transpires in the High Council for they are pelted away from every side

}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][10]

\flushleft{
And if any is able to snatch a fragment, he is pursued by a piercing flame.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][11]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So ask them (that is, human beings): “Were they harder to create than the objects We created?” We created them from sticky clay.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][12]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
You marvel (at the wondrous creations of Allah) and they scoff at it,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][13]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and when they are admonished, they pay no heed;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][14]

\flushleft{
and if they see any Sign, they laugh it away
}

\flushleft{
and say: “This is nothing but plain sorcery.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][16]

\flushleft{
Is it ever possible that after we die and are reduced to dust and (a skeleton of) bones, we will be raised to life?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][17]

\flushleft{
And so also shall our forefathers of yore be raised to life?”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][18]

\flushleft{
Tell them: “Yes; and you are utterly helpless (against Allah).”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
There will be a single stern rebuff and lo, they will be observing with their own eyes (all that they had been warned against).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will then say: “Woe for us. This is the Day of Judgement.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][21]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
“Yes, this is the Day of Final Decision that you used to deny as a lie.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

(Then will the command be given): “Muster all the wrong-doers and their spouses and the deities whom they used to serve

\flushleft{
apart from Allah, and direct them to the path of Hell,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][24]

\flushleft{
and detain them there; they will be called to account.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][25]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
How is it that you are not helping one another?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][26]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, today they are surrendering themselves completely.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][27]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will then turn towards each other (and start wrangling).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][28]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(The followers will say to their leaders): “You used to come to us from the right hand.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will say: “Nay, you yourselves were not the ones who would believe.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][30]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We had no power over you. You were a rebellious people,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and so we became deserving of the Word of our Lord that we shall be made to suffer chastisement.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So we led you astray; we ourselves were strayed.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
On that Day, they will all share the chastisement.
}

Thus do We treat the culprits.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][35]

\flushleft{
Whenever it was said to them: “There is no true deity apart from Allah,” they waxed proud
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][36]

\flushleft{
and said: “Shall we forsake our deities for the sake of a distracted poet?”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(They say so although) he brought the Truth and confirmed the veracity of the Messengers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(They will be told): “You shall taste the grievous chastisement.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][39]

\flushleft{
You will only be recompensed according to your deeds.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][40]

\flushleft{
But Allah's chosen servants (shall be spared this woeful end).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
For them awaits a known provision,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
a variety of delicious fruits; and they shall be honoured
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
in the Gardens of Bliss.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will be seated upon couches set face to face;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][45]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
a cup filled with wine from its springs, will be passed around to them;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][46]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
white, sparkling (wine), a delight to the drinkers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][47]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
There will neither be any harm in it for their body nor will it intoxicate their mind.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][48]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Theirs shall be wide-eyed maidens with bashful, restrained glances,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][49]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
so delicate as the hidden peel under an egg's shell.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][50]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then some of them will turn to others, and will ask each other.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][51]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
One of them will say: “I had a companion in the world
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][52]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
who used to say: -- Are you also one of those who confirm the Truth (of life after death)?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][53]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
After we are dead and have become all dust and bones shall we still be requited?'
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][54]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He will say: -- Do you wish to know where he is now?'
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][55]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then he will look downwards, and will see him in the depths of Hell.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][56]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He will say to him: -- By Allah, you almost ruined me.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][57]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But for Allah's favour, I should be one of those who have been mustered here.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][58]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So, are we not going to die,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][59]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
except for our first death? And shall we suffer no chastisement?'”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][60]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Surely this is the supreme triumph.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][61]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
For the like of it should the workers work.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][62]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Is this a better hospitality or the tree of al-Zaqqum?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][63]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We have made this tree a trial for the wrong-doers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][64]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
It is a tree that grows in the nethermost part of Hell.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][65]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Its spathes are like the heads of satans.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][66]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(The people of Hell) will surely eat of it, filling their bellies with it.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][67]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then on top of it they will have a brew of boiling water.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][68]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then their return will be to the same blazing Hell.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][69]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
These are the ones who found their fathers steeped in error,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][70]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and they are running in their footsteps.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][71]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Before them a multitude of people of olden times had erred,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][72]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and We had sent among them Messengers to warn them.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][73]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Observe, then, what was the end of those that had been warned,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
except for the chosen servants of Allah?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Noah had called upon Us (earlier). See, how excellent We were in answering him!
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][76]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We delivered him and his household from the great calamity;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][77]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and made his offspring the only ones to survive,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and We established for him a good name among posterity.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][79]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Peace be upon Noah among all the nations.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][80]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thus do We reward all those who do good.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][81]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Surely he was one of Our truly believing servants.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][82]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thereafter We caused the others to be drowned.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][83]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Abraham was on the self-same way (as Noah).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][84]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When he came to his Lord with a pure heart,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][85]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and said to his father and his people: “Whom do you worship?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][86]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Is it false deities that you want to serve rather than Allah?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][87]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
What do you think of the Lord of the whole Universe?”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][88]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then he looked carefully at the stars
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][89]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and said: “I am sick.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][90]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So turning their backs, they went away from him.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][91]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then he went quietly to the (temple of the deities) and said: “What is the matter with you, why do you not eat?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][92]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
What is the matter with you, why do you not speak?”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][93]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then he turned upon them, striking them with his right hand,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][94]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
whereupon people came to him running.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][95]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Abraham said to them: “Do you worship what you yourselves have carved with your own hands
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][96]

\flushleft{
while it is Allah Who has created you and all that you make?”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][97]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They spoke among themselves: “Build him a pyre and then throw him into the furnace.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][98]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They had contrived an evil plan against him, but We abased them all.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][99]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Abraham said: “I am going to my Lord; He will guide me.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][100]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Lord, grant me a righteous son.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][101]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(In response to this prayer) We gave him the good news of a prudent boy;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][102]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and when he was old enough to go about and work with him, (one day) Abraham said to him: “My son, I see in my dream that I am slaughtering you. So consider (and tell me) what you think.” He said: “Do as you are bidden. You will find me, if Allah so wills, among the steadfast.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][103]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When both surrendered (to Allah's command) and Abraham flung the son down on his forehead,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][104]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We cried out: “O Abraham,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][105]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
you have indeed fulfilled your dream. Thus do We reward the good-doers.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][106]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
This was indeed a plain trial.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][107]

\flushleft{
And We ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

and We preserved for him a good name among posterity.

Peace be upon Abraham.

Surely he was one of Our believing servants.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

And We gave him the good news of Isaac, a Prophet and among the righteous ones.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

And We blessed him and Isaac. Among the offspring of the two some did good and some plainly wronged themselves.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Verily We bestowed Our favours on Moses and Aaron

We succoured them, and they gained the upper hand (against their enemies).

\flushleft{
And Lot too was one of the Messengers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][134]

\flushleft{
(Call to mind) when We delivered him and all his kinsfolk,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
except for an old woman who was among those that stayed behind.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][136]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We utterly destroyed the rest of them.
}

\flushleft{
You pass by their desolate habitations in the morning
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

and at night. Do you still not understand?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][139]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Jonah too was one of the Messengers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][140]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Call to mind when he fled to the laden ship,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][141]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
cast lots, and was among the losers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][142]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then a fish swallowed him, and he was blameworthy.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][143]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Had he not been one of those who glorify Allah,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][144]

\flushleft{
he would certainly have remained in its belly till the Day of Resurrection.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][145]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But We threw him on a wide bare tract of land while he was ill;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][146]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and caused a gourd tree to grow over him,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][147]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and We sent him forth to a nation of a hundred thousand or more,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][148]

\flushleft{
and they believed. So We let them enjoy life for a while.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][149]

\flushleft{
So ask their opinion: “(Are you convinced) that your Lord should have daughters and you should have sons?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][150]

\flushleft{
Did We create the angels as females the while they witnessed?”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][151]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Behold, it is one of their fabrications that they say:
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][152]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
“Allah has begotten.” They are liars!
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][153]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Did He choose daughters rather than sons?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][154]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
What is the matter with you that you make such strange judgements?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Will you then not take heed?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Do you have any clear authority for such claims?

Bring your Book, if you are truthful.

all of them except the chosen servants of Allah.

\flushleft{
So you and your deities

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

shall not be able to tempt anyone away from Allah

As for us, there is none but has an appointed station.

“If only we had the Reminder which had been granted to the people of yore

we would surely have been Allah's chosen servants.”

We have already given Our promise to Our Messengers

\flushleft{
that they shall certainly be succoured,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

and that Our hosts shall triumph.

Leave them alone for a while,

\chapter{Sad (Sad)}
\begin{Arabic}
\Huge{\centerline{\basmalah}}\end{Arabic}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][1]

\flushleft{
Sad, and by the Qur'an full of exhortation!
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][2]

\flushleft{
Nay, but the unbelievers are steeped in arrogance and stubborn defiance.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][3]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
How many a nation did We destroy before them! (When they approached their doom) they cried out (for deliverance), but the time for deliverance was already past.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][4]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They wondered that a warner had come to them from among themselves, and the deniers of the Truth said: “This is a sorcerer, and a big liar.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][5]

\flushleft{
Has he made the gods one single God? This is truly astounding.”

We have not heard this in the religious community close to our time. This is nothing but a fabrication.

\quranayah[38][8]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Has this Exhortation been sent down among us only to him, to the exclusion of all others?” Nay, they are in doubt regarding My Exhortation, and are saying all this because they have not yet had any taste of My chastisement.

\quranayah[38][9]

\flushleft{
Do they possess the treasures of your Lord, the Most Mighty, the Great Bestower?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][10]

This is only a small army out of the several armies that will suffer defeat here.

Before them the people of Noah, Ad, and Pharaoh of the tent-pegs gave the lie (to the Messengers)

and so did Thamud and the people of Lot and the people of Aykah. These were all leagued together.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][14]

\flushleft{
Each of them gave the lie to Messengers and My decree of chastisement came upon them.

They are waiting for nothing except a single Cry, after which there will be no second Cry.

\flushleft{
(O Prophet), bear with patience what they say, and call to mind Our servant David, who was endowed with great strength and who constantly turned (to Allah).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
With him We had subjected the mountains that they join him in celebrating Allah's glory, evening and morning,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and the birds, too, in their flocks, and turn again and again to celebrating Allah's glory.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We strengthened his kingdom and endowed him with wisdom and decisive judgement.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][21]

\flushleft{
Has the story of the litigants reached you -- of those who entered his private chambers by climbing over the wall?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
As they came upon David -- and he was frightened of them -- they said: “Be not afraid. We are just two litigants: one of us has committed excess against the other. So judge rightly between us, and be not unjust; and guide us to the Right Way.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][23]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Behold, this is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have only one ewe.” And yet he said: “Give her into my charge,” and he got the better of me in argument.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][24]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
David said: “He has certainly wronged you in seeking to add your ewe to his ewes; and indeed many who live together commit excesses, one to the other, except those that believe and act righteously; and they are but few.” (While so saying) David realized that it is We Who have put him to test; therefore, he sought the forgiveness of his Lord, and fell down, bowing and penitently turning (to Him).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][25]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thereupon We forgave him his shortcoming and indeed (an exalted position of) nearness awaits him, and an excellent resort.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][26]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(We said to him): “O David, We have appointed you vicegerent on earth. Therefore, rule among people with justice and do not follow (your) desire lest it should lead you astray from Allah's Path. Allah's severe chastisement awaits those who stray away from Allah's Path, for they had forgotten the Day of Reckoning.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][27]

\flushleft{
We did not create this heaven and earth and all that lies between them in vain. That is the fancy of those who denied the Truth. So woe from the Fire to all who deny the Truth.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][28]

\flushleft{
Shall We then treat alike those that believe and act righteously and those that create mischief on earth? Or treat alike the God-fearing and the wicked?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
This is the Blessed Book that We have revealed to you, (O Muhammad), that people with understanding may reflect over its verses and those with understanding derive a lesson.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][30]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We bestowed upon David (an illustrious son), Solomon. How excellent a servant (of Ours he was)! Indeed he constantly turned to Us in devotion.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when one evening well-trained and running horses of noble breed were brought to him
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
he said: “Lo! I have come to love this wealth on account of the remembrance of my Lord.” And when the horses disappeared,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(he ordered): “Bring these horses back to me,” and then he began to gently stroke their shanks and necks.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][34]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Surely We put Solomon to the test and cast upon his throne a mere body. Thereupon he penitently turned (to Us).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][35]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said: “My Lord, forgive me and bestow upon me a kingdom such as none other after me will deserve. Surely You are the Bounteous Giver.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We subjected the wind to him, so that it blew gently at his bidding, wherever he directed it,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and We also subjected the devils to him -- all kinds of builders and divers;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and others that were bound with chains.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
“This is Our bestowal. So give or withhold as you wish without account.”

\flushleft{
Indeed an exalted position of nearness awaits him and an excellent resort.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][41]

\flushleft{
And remember Our servant Job: when he cried to his Lord: “Behold, Satan has afflicted me with much hardship and suffering.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(We commanded him): “Stamp your foot on earth, and here is cool water to wash with and to drink.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We granted to him his family and also the like of them, as a mercy from Us, and as a reminder to people of understanding,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(and We said to him): “Take in your hand a bundle of rushes and strike with it, and do not break your oath.” Indeed We found him steadfast. How excellent a servant (of Ours) he was. Indeed he constantly turned (to his Lord).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][45]

\flushleft{
And remember Our servants -- Abraham, Isaac and Jacob -- they were endowed with great strength and vision.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][46]

\flushleft{
Verily We exalted them in consideration of a sterling quality: their remembrance of the Abode of the Hereafter.

\flushleft{
In Our sight they are among the chosen and excellent ones.

And remember Ishmael, Elisha, and Dhu al-Kifl. All were of the best.

This was a remembrance. An excellent retreat awaits the God-fearing

wherein they shall recline, wherein they shall ask for abundant fruit and drinks,

and wherein there shall be with them well-matched, bashful mates.

Hell, where they will be roasted. An evil place to dwell!

All this (is for them); so let them taste boiling water and pus,

\flushleft{
Lo, religion is exclusively devoted to Allah. Your religion is entirely consecrated to Him. As for those who have taken others than Allah for their guardians, (they say): “We worship them only that they may bring us nearer to Allah.” Allah will judge between them concerning what they differ about. Verily Allah does not guide anyone who is given to sheer lying, is an utter unbeliever.

He it is Who created you from a single being, and He it is Who made from it its mate. He it is Who created for you eight heads of cattle in pairs.

So, whence are you being turned astray?

If you disbelieve, know well that Allah has no need of you. Yet He does not like unbelief in His servants. But if you are thankful, your thankfulness will please Him.

When any affliction befalls man, he cries out to his Lord, penitently turning to Him.

\flushleft{
Then a man endowed with faith, from Pharaoh's folk, who had kept his faith hidden, said: “Do you kill a person simply because he says: 'My Lord is Allah' even though he brought to you clear Signs from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lying will recoil upon him; but if he is truthful, you will be smitten with some of the awesome consequences of which he warns you. Allah does not guide to the Right Way any who exceeds the limits and is an utter liar.

My people, today the kingdom is yours, and you are supreme in the land. But if Allah's chastisement were to come upon you, who will come to our help?” Pharaoh said: “I only counsel what I consider right; I only direct you to the Path of Rectitude.”

Verily Joseph came to you with Clear Signs before, yet you continued to doubt his Message. Thereafter when he died, you said: 'Allah shall send no Messenger after him.'” Thus Allah leads astray those who transgress the limits and are given to much doubting;

\quranayah[40][35]

those who contend regarding Allah's Signs without any evidence that might have come to them. That is exceedingly loathsome to Allah and to those that believe. Thus does Allah seal the heart of everyone who is proud and high-handed.

As for Ad, they waxed proud in the land without justification and said: “Who is greater than we in strength?” Did they not see that Allah, Who created them, is greater in strength than they? They continued to deny Our Signs,

\quranayah[41][16]

whereupon We sent upon them a fierce wind on inauspicious days that We might make them taste a degrading chastisement in the life of this world. And surely the chastisement of the Hereafter is even more degrading. There will be none to help them there.

But how will they take heed? Such are they that a Messenger came to them clearly expounding the Truth,

yet they turned away from him and said: “This is a well-tutored madman.”

Yet We will hold the scourge back for a while, (but no sooner than We will do so) you will revert to your old ways.

(and said): “Deliver to me Allah's servants. I am a trustworthy Messenger to you,

and the life of ease in which they took delight!

Thus it was; and We made another people inherit all that.

It was not in idle sport that We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them.

It was stopped so that) Allah may admit to His Mercy whomsoever He pleases.

Muhammad is Allah's Messenger, and those who are with him are firm with the unbelievers but compassionate with one another. You see them occupied in bowing and prostrating and in seeking Allah's bounty and good pleasure. They are distinguished from others by the marks of prostration on their faces. Thus are they described in the Torah. And their parable in the Gospel is that of a tilth that puts forth its shoot, then strengthens it so that it becomes stout and stands firmly on its stem. This is a sight pleasing to the sowers and one by which the unbelievers will be enraged. As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, Allah has promised them forgiveness and a great reward.

If two parties of the believers happen to fight, make peace between them. But then, if one of them transgresses against the other, fight the one that transgresses until it reverts to Allah's command.

Believers, let not a group (of men) scoff at another group, it may well be that the latter (at whom they scoff) are better than they; nor let a group of women scoff at another group, it may well be that the latter are better than they.

Before all these We destroyed the people of Noah: they were a wicked people.

Flee, therefore, to Allah. Surely I am a clear warner to you from Him;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

and do not set up any deity with Allah. Surely I am a clear warner to you from Him.

Thus has it been (in the past): never did a Messenger come to the nations that preceded them but they said: “(He is) a sorcerer, or a mad-man.”

Have they arrived at a common understanding concerning this? No; but they are a people given to transgression.

So turn your attention away from them; you shall incur no blame.

I created the jinn and humans for nothing else but that they may serve Me;

I desire from them no provision, nor do I want them to feed Me.

verily your Lord's chastisement shall come to pass,

none can avert that.

and the mountains shall violently fly about.

Woe, then, on that Day to those who give the lie (to this Message)

and amuse themselves with vain argumentation.

Go now and burn in it. It is all the same whether you bear it patiently or do not bear it with patience. You are only being recompensed for your deeds.”

Surely the God-fearing shall be in Gardens and bliss,

enjoying what Allah will have endowed them with; and their Lord will have saved them from the torment of the Blazing Fire.

(They will be told): “Eat and drink to your hearts' content as a reward for your deeds.”

The God-fearing shall be reclining on couches facing each other, and We shall wed them to maidens with large, beautiful eyes.

We shall unite the believers with those descendants of theirs who followed them in their faith, and shall not deny them any part of the reward for their good deeds. Every person is pledged to what he did.

We shall provide them in abundance with all kinds of fruit and meat, whatever they may desire.

\quranayah[52][23]

They shall pass on to one another a cup that will incite neither levity nor sin.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][24]

Youths as fair as hidden pearls will be set apart to wait upon them; they will be running to and fro to serve them.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][25]

\flushleft{
They will turn to one another and ask (regarding the past events).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][26]

They will say: “When we were living before among our kinsfolk we lived in constant fear (of Allah's displeasure).

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][27]

\flushleft{
Then Allah graced us with His favour and saved us from the chastisement of the scorching wind.

Formerly we had always prayed to Him. Surely He is Most Benign, Most Compassionate.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So exhort (them, O Prophet), for by your Lord's Grace, you are neither a soothsayer nor a madman.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][30]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or do they say: “He is a poet for whom we await an adverse turn of fortune.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][31]

\flushleft{
Tell them: “Wait; I too am waiting with you.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][32]

\flushleft{
Do their minds prompt them to say such things, or are they a people immersed in transgression?”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Do they say: “He has himself fabricated the Qur'an?” No; the truth is that they are altogether averse to believing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][34]

\flushleft{
(If they are truthful in this), then let them produce a discourse of similar splendour.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Did they come into being without any creator? Or were they their own creators?
}

Or is it they who created the heavens and the earth? No; the truth is that they lack sure faith.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][37]

\flushleft{
Or do they have your Lord's treasures in their keeping? Or have absolute authority over them?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or do they have a ladder whereon they can climb and attempt to listen (to what is transpiring in the Higher Realm)? Then, let any of them who has listened to it produce a clear proof of it.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][39]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or does Allah have daughters whereas you have sons?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][40]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or is it that you ask of them any recompense so that they should fear to be weighed down under the burden of debt?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or is it that they have access to (the Truths in) the realm beyond sense-perception which they are writing down?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or are they contriving a stratagem against you? If so, that stratagem will rebound against the unbelievers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Do they have any god other than Allah? Exalted be Allah above whatever they associate (with Him in His Divinity).
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
(So obstinate are they that) even if they were to see some fragments of the sky falling down they would still say: “It is only a mass of cloud.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][45]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So leave them alone until they encounter that Day of theirs when they shall be struck down,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][46]

\flushleft{
when their stratagem shall be of no avail to them, nor shall they be succoured.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][47]
\end{Arabic}}

Surely a chastisement awaits the wrong-doers even before the coming of that Day; but most of them do not know.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[52][48]

Be patient, then, (O Prophet), until the judgement of your Lord comes. For surely you are before Our eyes. And celebrate the praise of your Lord when you rise,

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

and also celebrate His praise at night, and at the retreat of the stars.

By the star when it sets:
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][2]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
your companion has neither strayed nor is he deluded;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
nor does he speak out of his desire.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][4]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
This is nothing but a revelation that is conveyed to him,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][5]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
something that a very powerful one has imparted to him,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][6]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
one endowed with immense wisdom. He came forth and stood poised,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][7]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
being on the higher horizon.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][8]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then he drew near and hung above suspended,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][9]

\flushleft{
until he was two bows' length away, or nearer.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][10]

\flushleft{
Then he revealed to Allah's servant whatever he had to reveal.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][11]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
His heart added no untruth to what he saw.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][12]

Are you, then, going to contend with him regarding what he sees with his eyes?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][13]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed he saw him a second time,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][14]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
by the lote-tree at the farthest boundary,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
near which is the Garden of Abode.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][16]

\flushleft{
(This was) when the lote-tree was covered with that which covered it.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][17]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
His eye did not waver, nor did it stray,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
and he certainly saw some of the greatest Signs of His Lord.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][19]

\flushleft{
Have you ever thought about al-Lat and al-Uzza,

\flushleft{
and about the third deity, al-Manat?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Shall you have the male issues, and He the female issues?

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
That is indeed an unfair division!
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][23]

\flushleft{
These are nothing but names that you and your forefathers have invented, for which Allah has sent down no authority. They are merely following their conjectures and their carnal desires although guidance has come to them from their Lord.

Does man imagine that whatever he wishes for is right for him?

To Allah belong both the Next World and the present.

Numerous are the angels in the heavens; yet their intercession shall be of no avail, except in regard to those whom He grants the leave of intercession and whose plea He is pleased to accept.

Those who do not believe in the Hereafter give angels the names of females,

So leave alone those who turn away from the remembrance of Us and who seek nothing but the life of the world –
}

that being the utmost of their knowledge. Surely your Lord fully knows those who have strayed away from His Path and He also fully knows those who are rightly guided.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][31]

To Allah alone belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He will requite the evil-doers for their deeds and bestow a goodly reward on those who have done good,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
on those who avoid grave sins and shameful deeds, even if they may sometimes stumble into lesser offences. Surely your Lord is abounding in His Forgiveness. Very well is He aware of you since He produced you from the earth, and while you were still in your mothers' wombs and not yet born. So do not boastfully claim yourselves to be purified. He fully knows those that are truly Godfearing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

(O Prophet), did you see him who turned away (from the Path of Allah),

who gave a little, and then stopped?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][35]

Does he have any knowledge of the world beyond the ken of sense-perception, and therefore, clearly sees (the Truth)?

\flushleft{
Has he not been informed of what is in the Scrolls of Moses,

“That no bearer of a burden shall bear the burden of another,

And He brought perdition upon the subverted cities

The imminent Hour has drawn near,

and none but Allah can avert it.

\flushleft{
Will you, then, wonder at this?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][60]

\flushleft{
Will you laugh at it rather than weep?

Will you occupy yourselves simply in merriment?

Prostrate yourselves before Allah, and serve Him.

The Hour of Resurrection drew near and the moon split asunder.

(Regardless of any Signs these people see), they turn away and say: “This is an ongoing sorcery.”

Surely there came to them narratives (of the ancient nations) that should suffice to deter (them from transgression),

narratives that are full of consummate wisdom. But warnings do not avail them.

How is it that you do not expend in the Way of Allah when to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth? Those who spent their wealth and took part in fighting before the Victory cannot be equated (with those who spent their wealth and took part in fighting afterwards).

On that Day you will see believing men and women that their light will be running before them and on their right hands. (They will be told): “A good tiding to you today.” There shall be Gardens beneath which rivers flow; therein they shall abide. That indeed is the great triumph.

On that Day the hypocrites, both men and women, shall say to the believers: “Look at us that we may extract some light from your light.” They will be told: “Go back and seek light for yourselves elsewhere.” Then a wall shall be erected between them with a door in it.

The hypocrites will call out to the believers: “Were we not with you?” The believers will reply: “Yes; but you allowed yourselves to succumb to temptations, and you wavered and you remained in doubt and false expectations deluded you until Allah's command came to pass, and the Deluder deluded you concerning Allah.

Know well that the life of this world is merely sport and diversion and adornment and an object of your boasting with one another, and a rivalry in the multiplication of riches and children.

In their wake, We sent a succession of Our Messengers, and raised Jesus, son of Mary, after all of them, and bestowed upon him the Evangel, and We set tenderness and mercy in the hearts of those that followed him. As for monasticism, it is they who invented it; We did not prescribe it for them. They themselves invented it in pursuit of Allah's good pleasure, and then they did not observe it as it ought to have been observed. So We gave their reward to those of them that believed.

O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them for their waiting-period, and compute the waiting period accurately, and hold Allah, your Lord, in awe. Do not turn them out of their homes (during the waiting period) – nor should they go away (from their homes) – unless they have committed a manifestly evil deed. Such are the bounds set by Allah; and he who transgresses the bounds set by Allah commits a wrong against himself.

so that We might make it an instructive event for you, and retentive ears might preserve its memory.

So when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast

and the earth and the mountains are carried aloft and are crushed to bits at one stroke,

when the sky will be rent asunder, the grip holding it together having loosened on that Day,

and the angels will stand on the sides, with eight of them bearing aloft the Throne of your Lord on that Day.

That will be the Day when you shall be brought forth (before Allah) and no secret of yours shall remain hidden.

On that Day, he whose Record is given to him in his right hand will say: “Lo! Read my Record!

\flushleft{
Verily I was sure that I would be handed over my account.”
}

Then he shall find himself in a life of bliss;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
in a lofty Garden
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

the clusters of whose fruit will be hanging low to be within reach (of the inmates of Paradise).

As for him whose Record will be given to him in his left hand, he will exclaim: “Would that I had never been given my Record,

My riches have not availed me,

(A command will be issued): “Seize him and shackle him,

then cast him in the Fire,

then fasten him with a chain, seventy cubits long.

that this is the speech of an honourable Messenger,

not the speech of a poet. Little do you believe!

It has been revealed by the Lord of the Universe.
}

And if he [i.e., the Prophets] had forged this Discourse and thereafter ascribed it to Us,

We would surely have seized him by the right hand,

\flushleft{
and then severed his life vein;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
and not one of you would have been able to withhold Us from doing so.
}

Surely it is a Good Counsel for the God-fearing.

\flushleft{
We certainly know that some among you will give the lie to it,

and surely it will be a cause of regret for the unbelievers.

Certainly it is a Truth of absolute certainty.

\flushleft{
A beseecher besought the visitation of chastisement,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][2]

\flushleft{
(a chastisement meant) for the unbelievers, one which none can avert;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][3]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
a chastisement from Allah, the Lord of the ascending steps,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][4]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
by which the angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in one Day the duration of which is fifty thousand years.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So, (O Prophet), persevere with gracious perseverance.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][6]

\flushleft{
Verily they think that the chastisement is far off,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][7]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
while We think that it is near at hand.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][8]

\flushleft{
It shall befall on a Day whereon the sky will become like molten brass,

\flushleft{
and the mountains will become like dyed tufts of wool,

\flushleft{
and no bosom friend will enquire about any of his bosom friends
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

although they shall be within sight of one another. The guilty one would fain ransom himself from the torment of that Day by offering his children,

\flushleft{
and his spouse and his brother,

and his kinsfolk who had stood by him,
}

and all persons of the earth, if only he could thus save himself.

By no means! It will be the fierce flame

Verily man is impatient by nature:

\flushleft{
bewailing when evil befalls him,

\flushleft{
those who firmly believe in the Day of Recompense,

\flushleft{
and fear the chastisement of their Lord –
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
surely the chastisement of their Lord is a thing none can feel secure from –
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

and those who guard their private parts,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][30]

\flushleft{
except in regard to their spouses and those whom their right hands possess, for in regard to them they are not reproachable,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][31]

\flushleft{
but any who seeks to go beyond that, it is indeed they who are the transgressors,
}

\flushleft{
and those who fulfil their trusts and their covenants,

\flushleft{
and those who are upright in their testimonies;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

and who take due care of their Prayer:
}

\flushleft{
all these shall live honourably in the Gardens.

in crowds, both on the right and on the left?

Does everyone of them wish to enter the Garden of Bliss?
}

\flushleft{
By no means! They know that which We have created them from.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][40]

\flushleft{
I swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests that We have the power
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
to replace them by others who would be better than they; and We shall certainly not be overpowered.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][42]

So leave them to engage in vain talk and to amuse themselves until they come face to face with the Day which they are promised,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][43]

\flushleft{
the Day on which they will hastily come forth from their graves, as though they were hurrying on to the altars of their deities.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][44]

Their eyes will be downcast and disgrace will overwhelm them. Such is the Day that they were promised.

We sent Noah to his people (and directed him): “Warn your people before a grievous chastisement comes upon them.”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[71][2]

\flushleft{
Noah said: “My people, I have certainly been sent as a clear warner to you,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[71][3]

\flushleft{
that you serve Allah and fear Him, and follow me;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[71][4]

\flushleft{
He will forgive your sins and will grant you respite until an appointed term. Indeed when Allah's appointed term comes, it cannot be deferred; if you only knew!”
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[71][5]

\flushleft{
He said: “My Lord, I called my people by night and by day,

And every time I called them so that You might forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears and wrapped up their faces with their garments and obstinately clung to their attitude, and waxed very proud.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then I summoned them openly,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[71][9]

\flushleft{
and preached to them in public, and also addressed them in secret.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

I said to them: “Ask forgiveness from your Lord; surely He is Most Forgiving.

He will shower upon you torrents from heaven,

What is amiss with you that you do not look forward to the majesty of Allah

Do you not see how Allah has created seven heavens, one upon the other,

and has placed the moon in them as a light, and the sun as a radiant lamp?

And Allah has caused you to grow out of the earth so wondrously,

Allah has made the earth a wide expanse for you

(O Prophet), your Lord knows that you sometimes stand up in Prayer nearly two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half or one-third of it, and so does a party of those with you; Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you cannot keep an accurate count of it, so He has shown mercy to you. So now recite as much of the Qur'an as you can. He knows that there are among you those who are sick and others who are journeying in the land in quest of Allah's bounty, and still others who are fighting in the cause of Allah. So recite as much of the Qur'an as you easily can, and establish Prayer, and pay Zakah, and give Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah. That is better and its reward is greater. And ask for Allah's forgiveness; surely He is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.

and remember the name of your Lord, morning and evening;

We created them and strengthened their joints; and whenever We wish, We can change their faces entirely.

He admits to His Mercy whomsoever He pleases. As for the wrong-doers, He has prepared for them a grievous chastisement.

(O Prophet), your Lord has neither forsaken you, nor is He displeased.

\flushleft{
Indeed what is to come will be better for you than what has gone by.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[93][5]

\flushleft{
Verily your Lord will soon give you so amply that you will be well-pleased.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[93][6]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Did He not find you an orphan and then gave you shelter?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[93][7]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Did He not find you unaware of the Right Way, and then directed you to it?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[93][8]

\flushleft{
And did He not find you in want, and then enriched you?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[93][9]

\flushleft{
Therefore, be not harsh with the orphan;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

and proclaim the bounty of your Lord.

Indeed, there is ease with hardship.

Most certainly, there is ease with hardship.

So, whenever you are free, strive in devotion,

\flushleft{
and by this city (of Makkah), a haven of peace:
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
surely We created man in the best mould;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[95][5]

then We reverted him to the lowest of the low,

\flushleft{
Nay, surely man transgresses;

No indeed; if he does not desist, We shall drag him by the forelock;

by the lying forelock steeped in sin.

So let him summon his helpmates;

We too shall summon the guards of Hell.

Those who disbelieved – be they from the People of the Book or from those who associated others with Allah in His Divinity – will not desist from unbelief until the Clear Proof should come to them;

a Messenger from Allah, reciting from Purified Scrolls;

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[98][5]

\flushleft{
Yet all that they had been commanded was that they serve Allah, with utter sincerity, devoting themselves exclusively to Him, and that they establish Prayer and pay Zakah. That is the Right Faith.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[98][6]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Those who disbelieved – be they from among the People of the Book or among those who associated others with Allah in His Divinity– shall be in the Fire, and will abide in it. They are the worst of creatures.

But those that believe and work righteous deeds, they are the best of creatures.
}

Their recompense lies with their Lord: Gardens of eternity beneath which rivers flow; therein they shall dwell, forever and ever. Allah is well-pleased with them, and they are well-pleased with Him. All this is for him who fears his Lord.

On that Day people will go forth in varying states so that they be shown their deeds.

Verily man is most ungrateful to his Lord;

Is he not aware that when whatever lies (buried) in the graves is overthrown;
