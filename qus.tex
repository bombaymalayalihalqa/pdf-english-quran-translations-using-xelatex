This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah -

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][3]

\flushleft{
Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].

Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.

Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][7]

\flushleft{
Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.

And of the people are some who say, "We believe in Allah and the Last Day," but they are not believers.

They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.

In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.

And when it is said to them, "Do not cause corruption on the earth," they say, "We are but reformers."

Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][13]

And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Should we believe as the foolish have believed?" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][14]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, "Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][15]

[But] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly.

Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][17]

\flushleft{
Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][18]

\flushleft{
Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][19]

\flushleft{
Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.

O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous -

\quranayah[2][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to Allah equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][23]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][24]

\flushleft{
But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.

\flushleft{
And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow.

And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.

\quranayah[2][26]

Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, "What did Allah intend by this as an example?" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][27]

\flushleft{
Who break the covenant of Allah after contracting it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth. It is those who are the losers.

\flushleft{
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned.

\quranayah[2][29]

\flushleft{
It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven, [His being above all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][30]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority." They said, "Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?" Allah said, "Indeed, I know that which you do not know."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, "Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names." And when he had informed them of their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][34]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate before Adam"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][35]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We said, "O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, "Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We said, "Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.

O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant [upon you] that I will fulfill your covenant [from Me], and be afraid of [only] Me.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][42]

\flushleft{
And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].

And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience].

Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?

And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah]

O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][48]

\flushleft{
And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be aided.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][49]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when We saved your forefathers from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with the worst torment, slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][50]

\flushleft{
And [recall] when We parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][51]

\flushleft{
And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights. Then you took [for worship] the calf after him, while you were wrongdoers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][52]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][53]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when We gave Moses the Scripture and criterion that perhaps you would be guided.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][54]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when Moses said to his people, "O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves. That is best for [all of] you in the sight of your Creator." Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][55]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when you said, "O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah outright"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][56]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][57]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], "Eat from the good things with which We have provided you." And they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][58]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when We said, "Enter this city and eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, and enter the gate bowing humbly and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens.' We will [then] forgive your sins for you, and We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][59]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But those who wronged changed [those words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them, so We sent down upon those who wronged a punishment from the sky because they were defiantly disobeying.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][60]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when Moses prayed for water for his people, so We said, "Strike with your staff the stone." And there gushed forth from it twelve springs, and every people knew its watering place. "Eat and drink from the provision of Allah, and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][61]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when you said, "O Moses, we can never endure one [kind of] food. So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from the earth its green herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions." [Moses] said, "Would you exchange what is better for what is less? Go into [any] settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked." And they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from Allah [upon them]. That was because they [repeatedly] disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][62]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][63]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when We took your covenant, [O Children of Israel, to abide by the Torah] and We raised over you the mount, [saying], "Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][64]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then you turned away after that. And if not for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy, you would have been among the losers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][65]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the sabbath, and We said to them, "Be apes, despised."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][66]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded [them] and a lesson for those who fear Allah.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][67]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when Moses said to his people, "Indeed, Allah commands you to slaughter a cow." They said, "Do you take us in ridicule?" He said, "I seek refuge in Allah from being among the ignorant."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][68]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is." [Moses] said, "[Allah] says, 'It is a cow which is neither old nor virgin, but median between that,' so do what you are commanded."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][69]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "Call upon your Lord to show us what is her color." He said, "He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleasing to the observers.' "
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][70]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. Indeed, [all] cows look alike to us. And indeed we, if Allah wills, will be guided."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][71]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.' " They said, "Now you have come with the truth." So they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][72]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when you slew a man and disputed over it, but Allah was to bring out that which you were concealing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][73]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So, We said, "Strike the slain man with part of it." Thus does Allah bring the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you might reason.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones or even harder. For indeed, there are stones from which rivers burst forth, and there are some of them that split open and water comes out, and there are some of them that fall down for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of Allah and then distort the Torah after they had understood it while they were knowing?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][76]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We have believed"; but when they are alone with one another, they say, "Do you talk to them about what Allah has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your Lord?" Then will you not reason?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][77]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they declare?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Scripture except in wishful thinking, but they are only assuming.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][79]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So woe to those who write the "scripture" with their own hands, then say, "This is from Allah," in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][80]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they say, "Never will the Fire touch us, except for a few days." Say, "Have you taken a covenant with Allah? For Allah will never break His covenant. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][81]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Yes, whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][82]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But they who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][83]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], "Do not worship except Allah; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah." Then you turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][84]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], "Do not shed each other's blood or evict one another from your homes." Then you acknowledged [this] while you were witnessing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][85]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then, you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes, cooperating against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was forbidden to you. So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part? Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][86]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Those are the ones who have bought the life of this world [in exchange] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][87]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We did certainly give Moses the Torah and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][88]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they said, "Our hearts are wrapped." But, [in fact], Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is it that they believe.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][89]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allah will be upon the disbelievers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][90]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
How wretched is that for which they sold themselves - that they would disbelieve in what Allah has revealed through [their] outrage that Allah would send down His favor upon whom He wills from among His servants. So they returned having [earned] wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][91]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah has revealed," they say, "We believe [only] in what was revealed to us." And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, "Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you are [indeed] believers?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][92]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Moses had certainly brought you clear proofs. Then you took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][93]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [recall] when We took your covenant and raised over you the mount, [saying], "Take what We have given you with determination and listen." They said [instead], "We hear and disobey." And their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf because of their disbelief. Say, "How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[2][94]

Say, [O Muhammad], "If the home of the Hereafter with Allah is for you alone and not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

But they will never wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers.

O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury as does one who spends his wealth [only] to be seen by the people and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day.

And the example of those who spend their wealth seeking means to the approval of Allah and assuring [reward for] themselves is like a garden on high ground which is hit by a downpour - so it yields its fruits in double.

Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, "Trade is [just] like interest."

O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him.

And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon. And do not be [too] weary to write it, whether it is small or large, for its [specified] term. That is more just in the sight of Allah and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you, except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves. For [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. And take witnesses when you conclude a contract. Let no scribe be harmed or any witness.

Do they await except its result? The Day its result comes those who had ignored it before will say, "The messengers of our Lord had come with the truth, so are there [now] any intercessors to intercede for us or could we be sent back to do other than we used to do?"

Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne.

Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah, Lord of the worlds.

And it is He who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy until, when they have carried heavy rainclouds, We drive them to a dead land and We send down rain therein and bring forth thereby [some] of all the fruits. Thus will We bring forth the dead; perhaps you may be reminded.

Those cities - We relate to you, [O Muhammad], some of their news. And certainly did their messengers come to them with clear proofs, but they were not to believe in that which they had denied before. Thus does Allah seal over the hearts of the disbelievers.

He said, "Throw," and when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them, and they presented a great [feat of] magic.

And We inspired to Moses, "Throw your staff," and at once it devoured what they were falsifying.

So the truth was established, and abolished was what they were doing.

\flushleft{
But when good came to them, they said, "This is ours [by right]." And if a bad [condition] struck them, they saw an evil omen in Moses and those with him. Unquestionably, their fortune is with Allah, but most of them do not know.

So We sent upon them the flood and locusts and lice and frogs and blood as distinct signs, but they were arrogant and were a criminal people.

And We caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern regions of the land and the western ones, which We had blessed.

And We took the Children of Israel across the sea; then they came upon a people intent in devotion to [some] idols of theirs. They said, "O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods." He said, "Indeed, you are a people behaving ignorantly.

And We made an appointment with Moses for thirty nights and perfected them by [the addition of] ten; so the term of his Lord was completed as forty nights. And Moses said to his brother Aaron, "Take my place among my people, do right [by them], and do not follow the way of the corrupters."

And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, "My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You." [Allah] said, "You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me." But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, "Exalted are You!

I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right; and if they should see every sign, they will not believe in it.

And the people of Moses made, after [his departure], from their ornaments a calf - an image having a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way? They took it [for worship], and they were wrongdoers.

And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives and complete His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your fathers before, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is Knowing and Wise."

\quranayah[12][7]

\flushleft{
Certainly were there in Joseph and his brothers signs for those who ask,

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][8]

\flushleft{
When they said, "Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we, while we are a clan. Indeed, our father is in clear error.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][9]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Kill Joseph or cast him out to [another] land; the countenance of your father will [then] be only for you, and you will be after that a righteous people."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][10]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Said a speaker among them, "Do not kill Joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well; some travelers will pick him up - if you would do [something]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][11]

\flushleft{
They said, "O our father, why do you not entrust us with Joseph while indeed, we are to him sincere counselors?

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][12]

\flushleft{
Send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play. And indeed, we will be his guardians.

[Jacob] said, "Indeed, it saddens me that you should take him, and I fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][14]

\flushleft{
They said, "If a wolf should eat him while we are a [strong] clan, indeed, we would then be losers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][15]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So when they took him [out] and agreed to put him into the bottom of the well... But We inspired to him, "You will surely inform them [someday] about this affair of theirs while they do not perceive [your identity]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][16]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they came to their father at night, weeping.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][17]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "O our father, indeed we went racing each other and left Joseph with our possessions, and a wolf ate him. But you would not believe us, even if we were truthful."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they brought upon his shirt false blood. [Jacob] said, "Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. And Allah is the one sought for help against that which you describe."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And there came a company of travelers; then they sent their water drawer, and he let down his bucket. He said, "Good news! Here is a boy." And they concealed him, [taking him] as merchandise; and Allah was knowing of what they did.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][20]

\flushleft{
And they sold him for a reduced price - a few dirhams - and they were, concerning him, of those content with little.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][21]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And the one from Egypt who bought him said to his wife, "Make his residence comfortable. Perhaps he will benefit us, or we will adopt him as a son." And thus, We established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And Allah is predominant over His affair, but most of the people do not know.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when Joseph reached maturity, We gave him judgment and knowledge. And thus We reward the doers of good.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][23]

\flushleft{
And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him. She closed the doors and said, "Come, you." He said, "[I seek] the refuge of Allah. Indeed, he is my master, who has made good my residence. Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][24]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And she certainly determined [to seduce] him, and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof of his Lord. And thus [it was] that We should avert from him evil and immorality. Indeed, he was of Our chosen servants.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][25]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back, and they found her husband at the door. She said, "What is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][26]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Joseph] said, "It was she who sought to seduce me." And a witness from her family testified. "If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][27]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][28]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So when her husband saw his shirt torn from the back, he said, "Indeed, it is of the women's plan. Indeed, your plan is great.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Joseph, ignore this. And, [my wife], ask forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were of the sinful."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][30]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And women in the city said, "The wife of al-'Azeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy; he has impassioned her with love. Indeed, we see her [to be] in clear error."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said [to Joseph], "Come out before them." And when they saw him, they greatly admired him and cut their hands and said, "Perfect is Allah! This is not a man; this is none but a noble angel."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
She said, "That is the one about whom you blamed me. And I certainly sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused; and if he will not do what I order him, he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me. And if You do not avert from me their plan, I might incline toward them and [thus] be of the ignorant."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][34]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So his Lord responded to him and averted from him their plan. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][35]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs that al-'Azeez should surely imprison him for a time.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And there entered the prison with him two young men. One of them said, "Indeed, I have seen myself [in a dream] pressing wine." The other said, "Indeed, I have seen myself carrying upon my head [some] bread, from which the birds were eating. Inform us of its interpretation; indeed, we see you to be of those who do good."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "You will not receive food that is provided to you except that I will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. Indeed, I have left the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah, and they, in the Hereafter, are disbelievers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And it was not for us to associate anything with Allah. That is from the favor of Allah upon us and upon the people, but most of the people are not grateful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][39]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
O [my] two companions of prison, are separate lords better or Allah, the One, the Prevailing?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][40]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
You worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have named them, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. Legislation is not but for Allah. He has commanded that you worship not except Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
O two companions of prison, as for one of you, he will give drink to his master of wine; but as for the other, he will be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. The matter has been decreed about which you both inquire."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he said to the one whom he knew would go free, "Mention me before your master." But Satan made him forget the mention [to] his master, and Joseph remained in prison several years.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [subsequently] the king said, "Indeed, I have seen [in a dream] seven fat cows being eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry. O eminent ones, explain to me my vision, if you should interpret visions."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][44]

They said, "[It is but] a mixture of false dreams, and we are not learned in the interpretation of dreams."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][45]

\flushleft{
But the one who was freed and remembered after a time said, "I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me forth."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][46]

\flushleft{
[He said], "Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us about seven fat cows eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry - that I may return to the people; perhaps they will know [about you]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][47]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Joseph] said, "You will plant for seven years consecutively; and what you harvest leave in its spikes, except a little from which you will eat.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][48]

\flushleft{
Then will come after that seven difficult [years] which will consume what you saved for them, except a little from which you will store.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][49]

\flushleft{
Then will come after that a year in which the people will be given rain and in which they will press [olives and grapes]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][50]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And the king said, "Bring him to me." But when the messenger came to him, [Joseph] said, "Return to your master and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hands. Indeed, my Lord is Knowing of their plan."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][51]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Said [the king to the women], "What was your condition when you sought to seduce Joseph?" They said, "Perfect is Allah! We know about him no evil." The wife of al-'Azeez said, "Now the truth has become evident. It was I who sought to seduce him, and indeed, he is of the truthful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][52]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
That is so al-'Azeez will know that I did not betray him in [his] absence and that Allah does not guide the plan of betrayers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][53]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil, except those upon which my Lord has mercy. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][54]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And the king said, "Bring him to me; I will appoint him exclusively for myself." And when he spoke to him, he said, "Indeed, you are today established [in position] and trusted."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][55]

[Joseph] said, "Appoint me over the storehouses of the land. Indeed, I will be a knowing guardian."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][56]

\flushleft{
And thus We established Joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed. We touch with Our mercy whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][57]

\flushleft{
And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believed and were fearing Allah.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][58]

\flushleft{
And the brothers of Joseph came [seeking food], and they entered upon him; and he recognized them, but he was to them unknown.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][59]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when he had furnished them with their supplies, he said, "Bring me a brother of yours from your father. Do not you see that I give full measure and that I am the best of accommodators?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][60]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But if you do not bring him to me, no measure will there be [hereafter] for you from me, nor will you approach me."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][61]

\flushleft{
They said, "We will attempt to dissuade his father from [keeping] him, and indeed, we will do [it]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][62]

And [Joseph] said to his servants, "Put their merchandise into their saddlebags so they might recognize it when they have gone back to their people that perhaps they will [again] return."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][63]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So when they returned to their father, they said, "O our father, [further] measure has been denied to us, so send with us our brother [that] we will be given measure. And indeed, we will be his guardians."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][64]

He said, "Should I entrust you with him except [under coercion] as I entrusted you with his brother before? But Allah is the best guardian, and He is the most merciful of the merciful."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][65]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when they opened their baggage, they found their merchandise returned to them. They said, "O our father, what [more] could we desire? This is our merchandise returned to us. And we will obtain supplies for our family and protect our brother and obtain an increase of a camel's load; that is an easy measurement."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][66]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Jacob] said, "Never will I send him with you until you give me a promise by Allah that you will bring him [back] to me, unless you should be surrounded by enemies." And when they had given their promise, he said, "Allah, over what we say, is Witness."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][67]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he said, "O my sons, do not enter from one gate but enter from different gates; and I cannot avail you against [the decree of] Allah at all. The decision is only for Allah; upon Him I have relied, and upon Him let those who would rely [indeed] rely."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][68]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when they entered from where their father had ordered them, it did not avail them against Allah at all except [it was] a need within the soul of Jacob, which he satisfied. And indeed, he was a possessor of knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most of the people do not know.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][69]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his brother to himself; he said, "Indeed, I am your brother, so do not despair over what they used to do [to me]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][70]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So when he had furnished them with their supplies, he put the [gold measuring] bowl into the bag of his brother. Then an announcer called out, "O caravan, indeed you are thieves."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][71]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said while approaching them, "What is it you are missing?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][72]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "We are missing the measure of the king. And for he who produces it is [the reward of] a camel's load, and I am responsible for it."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][73]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "By Allah, you have certainly known that we did not come to cause corruption in the land, and we have not been thieves."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The accusers said, "Then what would be its recompense if you should be liars?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[The brothers] said, "Its recompense is that he in whose bag it is found - he [himself] will be its recompense. Thus do we recompense the wrongdoers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][76]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So he began [the search] with their bags before the bag of his brother; then he extracted it from the bag of his brother. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother within the religion of the king except that Allah willed. We raise in degrees whom We will, but over every possessor of knowledge is one [more] knowing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][77]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "If he steals - a brother of his has stolen before." But Joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them. He said, "You are worse in position, and Allah is most knowing of what you describe."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "O 'Azeez, indeed he has a father [who is] an old man, so take one of us in place of him. Indeed, we see you as a doer of good."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][79]

He said, "[I seek] the refuge of Allah [to prevent] that we take except him with whom we found our possession. Indeed, we would then be unjust."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][80]

\flushleft{
So when they had despaired of him, they secluded themselves in private consultation. The eldest of them said, "Do you not know that your father has taken upon you an oath by Allah and [that] before you failed in [your duty to] Joseph? So I will never leave [this] land until my father permits me or Allah decides for me, and He is the best of judges.

Return to your father and say, "O our father, indeed your son has stolen, and we did not testify except to what we knew. And we were not witnesses of the unseen,

[Jacob] said, "Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. Perhaps Allah will bring them to me all together. Indeed it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][84]

\flushleft{
And he turned away from them and said, "Oh, my sorrow over Joseph," and his eyes became white from grief, for he was [of that] a suppressor.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][85]

\flushleft{
They said, "By Allah, you will not cease remembering Joseph until you become fatally ill or become of those who perish."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][86]

He said, "I only complain of my suffering and my grief to Allah, and I know from Allah that which you do not know.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][87]

O my sons, go and find out about Joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from Allah. Indeed, no one despairs of relief from Allah except the disbelieving people."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][88]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So when they entered upon Joseph, they said, "O 'Azeez, adversity has touched us and our family, and we have come with goods poor in quality, but give us full measure and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allah rewards the charitable."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][89]

He said, "Do you know what you did with Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][90]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "Are you indeed Joseph?" He said "I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has certainly favored us. Indeed, he who fears Allah and is patient, then indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][91]

He said, "No blame will there be upon you today. Allah will forgive you; and He is the most merciful of the merciful."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[12][93]

Take this, my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father; he will become seeing. And bring me your family, all together."

And when the caravan departed [from Egypt], their father said, "Indeed, I find the smell of Joseph [and would say that he was alive] if you did not think me weakened in mind."

And he raised his parents upon the throne, and they bowed to him in prostration. And he said, "O my father, this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality.

Their garments of liquid pitch and their faces covered by the Fire.

Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the verses of the Book and a clear Qur'an.

\quranayah[15][2]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Perhaps those who disbelieve will wish that they had been Muslims.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted by [false] hope, for they are going to know.

\flushleft{
And We did not destroy any city but that for it was a known decree.

\flushleft{
No nation will precede its term, nor will they remain thereafter.

And they say, "O you upon whom the message has been sent down, indeed you are mad.

Why do you not bring us the angels, if you should be among the truthful?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][8]

We do not send down the angels except with truth; and the disbelievers would not then be reprieved.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][9]

\flushleft{
Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][10]

And We had certainly sent [messengers] before you, [O Muhammad], among the sects of the former peoples.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
And no messenger would come to them except that they ridiculed him.

\flushleft{
Thus do We insert denial into the hearts of the criminals.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][13]

They will not believe in it, while there has already occurred the precedent of the former peoples.

And [even] if We opened to them a gate from the heaven and they continued therein to ascend,

They would say, "Our eyes have only been dazzled. Rather, we are a people affected by magic."

And We have placed within the heaven great stars and have beautified it for the observers.

And indeed, it is We who give life and cause death, and We are the Inheritor.

And We did certainly create man out of clay from an altered black mud.

And the jinn We created before from scorching fire.

And when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul, then fall down to him in prostration."

So the angels prostrated - all of them entirely,

Except Iblees, he refused to be with those who prostrated.

[Allah] said, O Iblees, what is [the matter] with you that you are not with those who prostrate?"

He said, "Never would I prostrate to a human whom You created out of clay from an altered black mud."

[Allah] said, "Then get out of it, for indeed, you are expelled.

And indeed, upon you is the curse until the Day of Recompense."

He said, "My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected."

[Allah] said, "This is a path [of return] to Me [that is] straight.

Indeed, My servants - no authority will you have over them, except those who follow you of the deviators.

And indeed, Hell is the promised place for them all.

It has seven gates; for every gate is of them a portion designated."

[The angels] said, "Fear not. Indeed, we give you good tidings of a learned boy."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][54]

He said, "Have you given me good tidings although old age has come upon me? Then of what [wonder] do you inform?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][55]

\flushleft{
They said, "We have given you good tidings in truth, so do not be of the despairing."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][56]

\flushleft{
He said, "And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except for those astray?"

\quranayah[15][57]

\flushleft{
[Abraham] said, "Then what is your business [here], O messengers?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][58]

\flushleft{
They said, "Indeed, we have been sent to a people of criminals,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][59]

\flushleft{
Except the family of Lot; indeed, we will save them all

\flushleft{
Except his wife." Allah decreed that she is of those who remain behind.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][61]

\flushleft{
And when the messengers came to the family of Lot,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][62]

\flushleft{
He said, "Indeed, you are people unknown."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][63]

\flushleft{
They said, "But we have come to you with that about which they were disputing,
}

\flushleft{
And we have come to you with truth, and indeed, we are truthful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][65]

So set out with your family during a portion of the night and follow behind them and let not anyone among you look back and continue on to where you are commanded."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][66]

\flushleft{
And We conveyed to him [the decree] of that matter: that those [sinners] would be eliminated by early morning.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][67]

\flushleft{
And the people of the city came rejoicing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][68]

\flushleft{
[Lot] said, "Indeed, these are my guests, so do not shame me.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][70]

They said, "Have we not forbidden you from [protecting] people?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][71]

\flushleft{
[Lot] said, "These are my daughters - if you would be doers [of lawful marriage]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][72]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
By your life, [O Muhammad], indeed they were, in their intoxication, wandering blindly.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][73]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So the shriek seized them at sunrise.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of hard clay.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed in that are signs for those who discern.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][76]

\flushleft{
And indeed, those cities are [situated] on an established road.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][77]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed in that is a sign for the believers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And the companions of the thicket were [also] wrongdoers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][79]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So We took retribution from them, and indeed, both [cities] are on a clear highway.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][80]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And certainly did the companions of Thamud deny the messengers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][81]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We gave them Our signs, but from them they were turning away.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][82]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they used to carve from the mountains, houses, feeling secure.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][83]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But the shriek seized them at early morning.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][84]

\flushleft{
So nothing availed them [from] what they used to earn.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][85]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We have not created the heavens and earth and that between them except in truth. And indeed, the Hour is coming; so forgive with gracious forgiveness.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][86]

\flushleft{
Indeed, your Lord - He is the Knowing Creator.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][87]

\flushleft{
And We have certainly given you, [O Muhammad], seven of the often repeated [verses] and the great Qur'an.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][88]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [certain] categories of the disbelievers, and do not grieve over them. And lower your wing to the believers
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][89]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And say, "Indeed, I am the clear warner" -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][90]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Just as We had revealed [scriptures] to the separators
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][91]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Who have made the Qur'an into portions.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[15][92]

\flushleft{
So by your Lord, We will surely question them all
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
About what they used to do.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Then declare what you are commanded and turn away from the polytheists.

Indeed, We are sufficient for you against the mockers

Who make [equal] with Allah another deity. But they are going to know.

And We already know that your breast is constrained by what they say.

So exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord and be of those who prostrate [to Him].

Then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, [O Muhammad], if they do not believe in this message, [and] out of sorrow.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][7]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, We have made that which is on the earth adornment for it that We may test them [as to] which of them is best in deed.

And indeed, We will make that which is upon it [into] a barren ground.

Or have you thought that the companions of the cave and the inscription were, among Our signs, a wonder?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][10]

[Mention] when the youths retreated to the cave and said, "Our Lord, grant us from Yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][11]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So We cast [a cover of sleep] over their ears within the cave for a number of years.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][12]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We awakened them that We might show which of the two factions was most precise in calculating what [extent] they had remained in time.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][13]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
It is We who relate to you, [O Muhammad], their story in truth. Indeed, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][14]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We made firm their hearts when they stood up and said, "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Never will we invoke besides Him any deity. We would have certainly spoken, then, an excessive transgression.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][15]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
These, our people, have taken besides Him deities. Why do they not bring for [worship of] them a clear authority? And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allah a lie?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][16]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[The youths said to one another], "And when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than Allah, retreat to the cave. Your Lord will spread out for you of His mercy and will prepare for you from your affair facility."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][17]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [had you been present], you would see the sun when it rose, inclining away from their cave on the right, and when it set, passing away from them on the left, while they were [laying] within an open space thereof. That was from the signs of Allah. He whom Allah guides is the [rightly] guided, but he whom He leaves astray - never will you find for him a protecting guide.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And you would think them awake, while they were asleep. And We turned them to the right and to the left, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. If you had looked at them, you would have turned from them in flight and been filled by them with terror.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And similarly, We awakened them that they might question one another. Said a speaker from among them, "How long have you remained [here]?" They said, "We have remained a day or part of a day." They said, "Your Lord is most knowing of how long you remained. So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city and let him look to which is the best of food and bring you provision from it and let him be cautious. And let no one be aware of you.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][20]

Indeed, if they come to know of you, they will stone you or return you to their religion. And never would you succeed, then - ever."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][21]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And similarly, We caused them to be found that they [who found them] would know that the promise of Allah is truth and that of the Hour there is no doubt. [That was] when they disputed among themselves about their affair and [then] said, "Construct over them a structure. Their Lord is most knowing about them." Said those who prevailed in the matter, "We will surely take [for ourselves] over them a masjid."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will say there were three, the fourth of them being their dog; and they will say there were five, the sixth of them being their dog - guessing at the unseen; and they will say there were seven, and the eighth of them was their dog. Say, [O Muhammad], "My Lord is most knowing of their number. None knows them except a few. So do not argue about them except with an obvious argument and do not inquire about them among [the speculators] from anyone."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][23]

And keep yourself patient [by being] with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His countenance.

And say, "The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve." Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which scalds [their] faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - indeed, We will not allow to be lost the reward of any who did well in deeds.

Those will have gardens of perpetual residence; beneath them rivers will flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade, reclining therein on adorned couches. Excellent is the reward, and good is the resting place.

\quranayah[18][32]

And present to them an example of two men: We granted to one of them two gardens of grapevines, and We bordered them with palm trees and placed between them [fields of] crops.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][33]
\end{Arabic}}

Each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything. And We caused to gush forth within them a river.

And I do not think the Hour will occur. And even if I should be brought back to my Lord, I will surely find better than this as a return."

And why did you, when you entered your garden, not say, 'What Allah willed [has occurred]; there is no power except in Allah '? Although you see me less than you in wealth and children,

\quranayah[18][40]

It may be that my Lord will give me [something] better than your garden and will send upon it a calamity from the sky, and it will become a smooth, dusty ground,

And his fruits were encompassed [by ruin], so he began to turn his hands about [in dismay] over what he had spent on it, while it had collapsed upon its trellises, and said, "Oh, I wish I had not associated with my Lord anyone."

There the authority is [completely] for Allah, the Truth. He is best in reward and best in outcome.

And present to them the example of the life of this world, [its being] like rain which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and [then] it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds. And Allah is ever, over all things, Perfect in Ability.

Wealth and children are [but] adornment of the worldly life. But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for [one's] hope.

And [warn of] the Day when We will remove the mountains and you will see the earth prominent, and We will gather them and not leave behind from them anyone.

And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam," and they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord.

And We have certainly diversified in this Qur'an for the people from every [kind of] example; but man has ever been, most of anything, [prone to] dispute.

And nothing has prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness of their Lord except that there [must] befall them the [accustomed] precedent of the former peoples or that the punishment should come [directly] before them.

\quranayah[18][56]

And We send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners. And those who disbelieve dispute by [using] falsehood to [attempt to] invalidate thereby the truth and have taken My verses, and that of which they are warned, in ridicule.

\quranayah[18][57]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his Lord but turns away from them and forgets what his hands have put forth? Indeed, We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And if you invite them to guidance - they will never be guided, then - ever.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][58]

And your Lord is the Forgiving, full of mercy. If He were to impose blame upon them for what they earned, He would have hastened for them the punishment. Rather, for them is an appointment from which they will never find an escape.

\quranayah[18][59]

And those cities - We destroyed them when they wronged, and We made for their destruction an appointed time.

And [mention] when Moses said to his servant, "I will not cease [traveling] until I reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period."

\flushleft{
But when they reached the junction between them, they forgot their fish, and it took its course into the sea, slipping away.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][62]

\flushleft{
So when they had passed beyond it, [Moses] said to his boy, "Bring us our morning meal. We have certainly suffered in this, our journey, [much] fatigue."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][63]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "Did you see when we retired to the rock? Indeed, I forgot [there] the fish. And none made me forget it except Satan - that I should mention it. And it took its course into the sea amazingly".
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][64]

[Moses] said, "That is what we were seeking." So they returned, following their footprints.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][65]

And they found a servant from among Our servants to whom we had given mercy from us and had taught him from Us a [certain] knowledge.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][66]

He said, "Indeed, with me you will never be able to have patience.

And how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge?"

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][71]

\flushleft{
So they set out, until when they had embarked on the ship, al-Khidh r tore it open. [Moses] said, "Have you torn it open to drown its people? You have certainly done a grave thing."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][72]

[Al-Khidh r] said, "Did I not say that with me you would never be able to have patience?"

[Moses] said, "Do not blame me for what I forgot and do not cover me in my matter with difficulty."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So they set out, until when they met a boy, al-Khidh r killed him. [Moses] said, "Have you killed a pure soul for other than [having killed] a soul? You have certainly done a deplorable thing."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Al-Khidh r] said, "Did I not tell you that with me you would never be able to have patience?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][76]

\flushleft{
[Moses] said, "If I should ask you about anything after this, then do not keep me as a companion. You have obtained from me an excuse."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][77]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So they set out, until when they came to the people of a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. And they found therein a wall about to collapse, so al-Khidh r restored it. [Moses] said, "If you wished, you could have taken for it a payment."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Al-Khidh r] said, "This is parting between me and you. I will inform you of the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][79]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working at sea. So I intended to cause defect in it as there was after them a king who seized every [good] ship by force.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][80]

\flushleft{
And as for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared that he would overburden them by transgression and disbelief.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][81]

\flushleft{
So we intended that their Lord should substitute for them one better than him in purity and nearer to mercy.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][82]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure for them, and their father had been righteous. So your Lord intended that they reach maturity and extract their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. And I did it not of my own accord. That is the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][83]

And they ask you, [O Muhammad], about Dhul-Qarnayn. Say, "I will recite to you about him a report."

\flushleft{
Indeed We established him upon the earth, and We gave him to everything a way.

So he followed a way

\quranayah[18][86]

\flushleft{
Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it [as if] setting in a spring of dark mud, and he found near it a people. Allah said, "O Dhul-Qarnayn, either you punish [them] or else adopt among them [a way of] goodness."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][87]

Until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had not made against it any shield.

\flushleft{
Thus. And We had encompassed [all] that he had in knowledge.

Then he followed a way

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][93]

Until, when he reached [a pass] between two mountains, he found beside them a people who could hardly understand [his] speech.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][94]

\flushleft{
They said, "O Dhul-Qarnayn, indeed Gog and Magog are [great] corrupters in the land. So may we assign for you an expenditure that you might make between us and them a barrier?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][95]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "That in which my Lord has established me is better [than what you offer], but assist me with strength; I will make between you and them a dam.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Bring me sheets of iron" - until, when he had leveled [them] between the two mountain walls, he said, "Blow [with bellows]," until when he had made it [like] fire, he said, "Bring me, that I may pour over it molten copper."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[18][97]

So Gog and Magog were unable to pass over it, nor were they able [to effect] in it any penetration.

[Dhul-Qarnayn] said, "This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord comes, He will make it level, and ever is the promise of my Lord true."

But he called her from below her, "Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream.

And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates.

Then the factions differed [concerning Jesus] from among them, so woe to those who disbelieved - from the scene of a tremendous Day.

[Mention] when he said to his father, "O my father, why do you worship that which does not hear and does not see and will not benefit you at all?

O my father, indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to an even path.

O my father, do not worship Satan. Indeed Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient.

O my father, indeed I fear that there will touch you a punishment from the Most Merciful so you would be to Satan a companion [in Hellfire]."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[19][46]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[His father] said, "Have you no desire for my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you, so avoid me a prolonged time."

[Abraham] said, "Peace will be upon you. I will ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Indeed, He is ever gracious to me.

And I will leave you and those you invoke other than Allah and will invoke my Lord. I expect that I will not be in invocation to my Lord unhappy."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[19][49]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So when he had left them and those they worshipped other than Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each [of them] We made a prophet.

And We gave them of Our mercy, and we made for them a reputation of high honor.

And mention in the Book, Moses. Indeed, he was chosen, and he was a messenger and a prophet.

And We called him from the side of the mount at [his] right and brought him near, confiding [to him].

And We gave him out of Our mercy his brother Aaron as a prophet.

Those were the ones upon whom Allah bestowed favor from among the prophets of the descendants of Adam and of those We carried [in the ship] with Noah, and of the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and of those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Merciful were recited to them, they fell in prostration and weeping.

But there came after them successors who neglected prayer and pursued desires; so they are going to meet evil -

Except those who repent, believe and do righteousness; for those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged at all.

[Therein are] gardens of perpetual residence which the Most Merciful has promised His servants in the unseen. Indeed, His promise has ever been coming.

They will not hear therein any ill speech - only [greetings of] peace - and they will have their provision therein, morning and afternoon.

That is Paradise, which We give as inheritance to those of Our servants who were fearing of Allah.

[Gabriel said], "And we [angels] descend not except by the order of your Lord. To Him belongs that before us and that behind us and what is in between. And never is your Lord forgetful -

Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them - so worship Him and have patience for His worship. Do you know of any similarity to Him?"

And the disbeliever says, "When I have died, am I going to be brought forth alive?"

Does man not remember that We created him before, while he was nothing?

So by your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils; then We will bring them to be present around Hell upon their knees.

\quranayah[19][69]

\flushleft{
Then We will surely extract from every sect those of them who were worst against the Most Merciful in insolence.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[19][70]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then, surely it is We who are most knowing of those most worthy of burning therein.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[19][71]

\flushleft{
And there is none of you except he will come to it. This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[19][72]

Then We will save those who feared Allah and leave the wrongdoers within it, on their knees.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[19][73]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Which of [our] two parties is best in position and best in association?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[19][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And how many a generation have We destroyed before them who were better in possessions and [outward] appearance?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[19][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Say, "Whoever is in error - let the Most Merciful extend for him an extension [in wealth and time] until, when they see that which they were promised - either punishment [in this world] or the Hour [of resurrection] - they will come to know who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[19][76]

\flushleft{
And Allah increases those who were guided, in guidance, and the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for recourse.

\quranayah[19][77]

\flushleft{
Then, have you seen he who disbelieved in Our verses and said, "I will surely be given wealth and children [in the next life]?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[19][78]

\flushleft{
Has he looked into the unseen, or has he taken from the Most Merciful a promise?

\flushleft{
No! We will record what he says and extend for him from the punishment extensively.

And We will inherit him [in] what he mentions, and he will come to Us alone.

And they have taken besides Allah [false] deities that they would be for them [a source of] honor.

No! Those "gods" will deny their worship of them and will be against them opponents [on the Day of Judgement].

Do you not see that We have sent the devils upon the disbelievers, inciting them to [evil] with [constant] incitement?

You have done an atrocious thing.

The heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation

That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son.

There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant.

He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting.

And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone.

Aaron, my brother.

Increase through him my strength

[Allah] said, "You have been granted your request, O Moses.

And We had already conferred favor upon you another time,

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][38]

\flushleft{
When We inspired to your mother what We inspired,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][39]

\flushleft{
[Saying], 'Cast him into the chest and cast it into the river, and the river will throw it onto the bank; there will take him an enemy to Me and an enemy to him.' And I bestowed upon you love from Me that you would be brought up under My eye.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][40]

\flushleft{
[And We favored you] when your sister went and said, 'Shall I direct you to someone who will be responsible for him?' So We restored you to your mother that she might be content and not grieve. And you killed someone, but We saved you from retaliation and tried you with a [severe] trial. And you remained [some] years among the people of Madyan. Then you came [here] at the decreed time, O Moses.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][41]

\flushleft{
And I produced you for Myself.

Go, you and your brother, with My signs and do not slacken in My remembrance.

Go, both of you, to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed.

So go to him and say, 'Indeed, we are messengers of your Lord, so send with us the Children of Israel and do not torment them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And peace will be upon he who follows the guidance.

[It is He] who has made for you the earth as a bed [spread out] and inserted therein for you roadways and sent down from the sky, rain and produced thereby categories of various plants.

And We certainly showed Pharaoh Our signs - all of them - but he denied and refused.

He said, "Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses?

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][58]

Then we will surely bring you magic like it, so make between us and you an appointment, which we will not fail to keep and neither will you, in a place assigned."

So Pharaoh went away, put together his plan, and then came [to Moses].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][61]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Moses said to the magicians summoned by Pharaoh, "Woe to you! Do not invent a lie against Allah or He will exterminate you with a punishment; and he has failed who invents [such falsehood]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

So they disputed over their affair among themselves and concealed their private conversation.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][63]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "Indeed, these are two magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your most exemplary way.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][64]

\flushleft{
So resolve upon your plan and then come [forward] in line. And he has succeeded today who overcomes."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][65]

\flushleft{
They said, "O Moses, either you throw or we will be the first to throw."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][66]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "Rather, you throw." And suddenly their ropes and staffs seemed to him from their magic that they were moving [like snakes].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][67]

\flushleft{
And he sensed within himself apprehension, did Moses.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Allah said, "Fear not. Indeed, it is you who are superior.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][69]

\flushleft{
And throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have crafted. What they have crafted is but the trick of a magician, and the magician will not succeed wherever he is."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][70]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So the magicians fell down in prostration. They said, "We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][71]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Pharaoh] said, "You believed him before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and you will surely know which of us is more severe in [giving] punishment and more enduring."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][72]

\flushleft{
They said, "Never will we prefer you over what has come to us of clear proofs and [over] He who created us. So decree whatever you are to decree. You can only decree for this worldly life.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][73]

\flushleft{
Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and what you compelled us [to do] of magic. And Allah is better and more enduring."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal - indeed, for him is Hell; he will neither die therein nor live.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But whoever comes to Him as a believer having done righteous deeds - for those will be the highest degrees [in position]:
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][76]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. And that is the reward of one who purifies himself.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][77]

\flushleft{
And We had inspired to Moses, "Travel by night with My servants and strike for them a dry path through the sea; you will not fear being overtaken [by Pharaoh] nor be afraid [of drowning]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, and there covered them from the sea that which covered them,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][79]

\flushleft{
And Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide [them].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][80]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
O Children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and We made an appointment with you at the right side of the mount, and We sent down to you manna and quails,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][81]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Saying], "Eat from the good things with which We have provided you and do not transgress [or oppress others] therein, lest My anger should descend upon you. And he upon whom My anger descends has certainly fallen."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][82]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][83]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Allah] said, "And what made you hasten from your people, O Moses?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][84]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "They are close upon my tracks, and I hastened to You, my Lord, that You be pleased."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][85]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Allah] said, "But indeed, We have tried your people after you [departed], and the Samiri has led them astray."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][86]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved. He said, "O my people, did your Lord not make you a good promise? Then, was the time [of its fulfillment] too long for you, or did you wish that wrath from your Lord descend upon you, so you broke your promise [of obedience] to me?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][87]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "We did not break our promise to you by our will, but we were made to carry burdens from the ornaments of the people [of Pharaoh], so we threw them [into the fire], and thus did the Samiri throw."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][88]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he extracted for them [the statue of] a calf which had a lowing sound, and they said, "This is your god and the god of Moses, but he forgot."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][89]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Did they not see that it could not return to them any speech and that it did not possess for them any harm or benefit?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][90]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Aaron had already told them before [the return of Moses], "O my people, you are only being tested by it, and indeed, your Lord is the Most Merciful, so follow me and obey my order."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][91]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "We will never cease being devoted to the calf until Moses returns to us."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][92]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Moses] said, "O Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][93]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
From following me? Then have you disobeyed my order?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][94]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Aaron] said, "O son of my mother, do not seize [me] by my beard or by my head. Indeed, I feared that you would say, 'You caused division among the Children of Israel, and you did not observe [or await] my word.' "
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][95]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Moses] said, "And what is your case, O Samiri?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][96]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful [of dust] from the track of the messenger and threw it, and thus did my soul entice me."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][97]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Moses] said, "Then go. And indeed, it is [decreed] for you in [this] life to say, 'No contact.' And indeed, you have an appointment [in the Hereafter] you will not fail to keep. And look at your 'god' to which you remained devoted. We will surely burn it and blow it into the sea with a blast.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][98]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Your god is only Allah, except for whom there is no deity. He has encompassed all things in knowledge."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][99]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thus, [O Muhammad], We relate to you from the news of what has preceded. And We have certainly given you from Us the Qur'an.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][100]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Whoever turns away from it - then indeed, he will bear on the Day of Resurrection a burden,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][101]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Abiding] eternally therein, and evil it is for them on the Day of Resurrection as a load -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][102]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The Day the Horn will be blown. And We will gather the criminals, that Day, blue-eyed.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][103]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will murmur among themselves, "You remained not but ten [days in the world]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][104]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We are most knowing of what they say when the best of them in manner will say, "You remained not but one day."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][105]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they ask you about the mountains, so say, "My Lord will blow them away with a blast.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][106]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And He will leave the earth a level plain;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][107]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
You will not see therein a depression or an elevation."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][108]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
That Day, everyone will follow [the call of] the Caller [with] no deviation therefrom, and [all] voices will be stilled before the Most Merciful, so you will not hear except a whisper [of footsteps].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][109]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
That Day, no intercession will benefit except [that of] one to whom the Most Merciful has given permission and has accepted his word.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][110]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Allah knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, but they do not encompass it in knowledge.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][111]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [all] faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. And he will have failed who carries injustice.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][112]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But he who does of righteous deeds while he is a believer - he will neither fear injustice nor deprivation.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][113]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an and have diversified therein the warnings that perhaps they will avoid [sin] or it would cause them remembrance.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][114]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So high [above all] is Allah, the Sovereign, the Truth. And, [O Muhammad], do not hasten with [recitation of] the Qur'an before its revelation is completed to you, and say, "My Lord, increase me in knowledge."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][115]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We had already taken a promise from Adam before, but he forgot; and We found not in him determination.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][116]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam," and they prostrated, except Iblees; he refused.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][117]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So We said, "O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife. Then let him not remove you from Paradise so you would suffer.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][118]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, it is [promised] for you not to be hungry therein or be unclothed.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][119]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And indeed, you will not be thirsty therein or be hot from the sun."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][120]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then Satan whispered to him; he said, "O Adam, shall I direct you to the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][121]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Adam and his wife ate of it, and their private parts became apparent to them, and they began to fasten over themselves from the leaves of Paradise. And Adam disobeyed his Lord and erred.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][122]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then his Lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided [him].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][123]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Allah] said, "Descend from Paradise - all, [your descendants] being enemies to one another. And if there should come to you guidance from Me - then whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray [in the world] nor suffer [in the Hereafter].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][124]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And whoever turns away from My remembrance - indeed, he will have a depressed life, and We will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][125]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He will say, "My Lord, why have you raised me blind while I was [once] seeing?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][126]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Allah] will say, "Thus did Our signs come to you, and you forgot them; and thus will you this Day be forgotten."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][127]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And thus do We recompense he who transgressed and did not believe in the signs of his Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more enduring.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][128]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then, has it not become clear to them how many generations We destroyed before them as they walk among their dwellings? Indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][129]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And if not for a word that preceded from your Lord, punishment would have been an obligation [due immediately], and [if not for] a specified term [decreed].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][130]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So be patient over what they say and exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting; and during periods of the night [exalt Him] and at the ends of the day, that you may be satisfied.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][131]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, [its being but] the splendor of worldly life by which We test them. And the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][132]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And enjoin prayer upon your family [and people] and be steadfast therein. We ask you not for provision; We provide for you, and the [best] outcome is for [those of] righteousness.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][133]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they say, "Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?" Has there not come to them evidence of what was in the former scriptures?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][134]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before him, they would have said, "Our Lord, why did You not send to us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses before we were humiliated and disgraced?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[20][135]

Do you not see that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the moving creatures and many of the people? But upon many the punishment has been justified. And he whom Allah humiliates - for him there is no bestower of honor. Indeed, Allah does what He wills.

Indeed, those who have disbelieved and avert [people] from the way of Allah and [from] al-Masjid al-Haram, which We made for the people - equal are the resident therein and one from outside; and [also] whoever intends [a deed] therein of deviation [in religion] or wrongdoing - We will make him taste of a painful punishment.

And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, you recognize in the faces of those who disbelieve disapproval.

And strive for Allah with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty. [It is] the religion of your father, Abraham.

[Pharaoh] said, "Did we not raise you among us as a child, and you remained among us for years of your life?

And [then] you did your deed which you did, and you were of the ungrateful."

[Moses] said, "I did it, then, while I was of those astray.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][21]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So I fled from you when I feared you. Then my Lord granted me wisdom and prophethood and appointed me [as one] of the messengers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And is this a favor of which you remind me - that you have enslaved the Children of Israel?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][23]

\flushleft{
Said Pharaoh, "And what is the Lord of the worlds?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][24]

\flushleft{
[Moses] said, "The Lord of the heavens and earth and that between them, if you should be convinced."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][25]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Pharaoh] said to those around him, "Do you not hear?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][26]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Moses] said, "Your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][27]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Pharaoh] said, "Indeed, your 'messenger' who has been sent to you is mad."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][28]

\flushleft{
[Moses] said, "Lord of the east and the west and that between them, if you were to reason."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Pharaoh] said, "If you take a god other than me, I will surely place you among those imprisoned."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][30]

\flushleft{
[Moses] said, "Even if I brought you proof manifest?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Pharaoh] said, "Then bring it, if you should be of the truthful."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So [Moses] threw his staff, and suddenly it was a serpent manifest.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he drew out his hand; thereupon it was white for the observers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][34]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Pharaoh] said to the eminent ones around him, "Indeed, this is a learned magician.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][35]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He wants to drive you out of your land by his magic, so what do you advise?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "Postpone [the matter of] him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Who will bring you every learned, skilled magician."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So the magicians were assembled for the appointment of a well-known day.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][39]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And it was said to the people, "Will you congregate
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][40]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
That we might follow the magicians if they are the predominant?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when the magicians arrived, they said to Pharaoh, "Is there indeed for us a reward if we are the predominant?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "Yes, and indeed, you will then be of those near [to me]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Moses said to them, "Throw whatever you will throw."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So they threw their ropes and their staffs and said, "By the might of Pharaoh, indeed it is we who are predominant."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][45]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then Moses threw his staff, and at once it devoured what they falsified.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][46]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So the magicians fell down in prostration [to Allah].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][47]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "We have believed in the Lord of the worlds,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][48]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][49]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Pharaoh] said, "You believed Moses before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you magic, but you are going to know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you all."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][50]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "No harm. Indeed, to our Lord we will return.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][51]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, we aspire that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we were the first of the believers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][52]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We inspired to Moses, "Travel by night with My servants; indeed, you will be pursued."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][53]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then Pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][54]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[And said], "Indeed, those are but a small band,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][55]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And indeed, they are enraging us,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][56]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And indeed, we are a cautious society... "
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][57]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So We removed them from gardens and springs
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][58]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And treasures and honorable station -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][59]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Thus. And We caused to inherit it the Children of Israel.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][60]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So they pursued them at sunrise.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][61]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when the two companies saw one another, the companions of Moses said, "Indeed, we are to be overtaken!"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][62]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Moses] said, "No! Indeed, with me is my Lord; He will guide me."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][63]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We inspired to Moses, "Strike with your staff the sea," and it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][64]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We advanced thereto the pursuers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][65]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We saved Moses and those with him, all together.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][66]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We drowned the others.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][67]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][68]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][69]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And recite to them the news of Abraham,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][70]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][71]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "We worship idols and remain to them devoted."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][72]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "Do they hear you when you supplicate?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][73]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or do they benefit you, or do they harm?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "But we found our fathers doing thus."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "Then do you see what you have been worshipping,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][76]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
You and your ancient forefathers?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][77]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Who created me, and He [it is who] guides me.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][79]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And it is He who feeds me and gives me drink.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][80]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when I am ill, it is He who cures me
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][81]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And who will cause me to die and then bring me to life
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][82]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And who I aspire that He will forgive me my sin on the Day of Recompense."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][83]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[And he said], "My Lord, grant me authority and join me with the righteous.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][84]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And grant me a reputation of honor among later generations.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][85]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Pleasure.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][86]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And forgive my father. Indeed, he has been of those astray.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][87]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And do not disgrace me on the Day they are [all] resurrected -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][88]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][89]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][90]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Paradise will be brought near [that Day] to the righteous.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][91]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Hellfire will be brought forth for the deviators,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][92]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And it will be said to them, "Where are those you used to worship
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][93]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Other than Allah? Can they help you or help themselves?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][94]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So they will be overturned into Hellfire, they and the deviators
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][95]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And the soldiers of Iblees, all together.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][96]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will say while they dispute therein,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][97]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
"By Allah, we were indeed in manifest error
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][98]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When we equated you with the Lord of the worlds.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][99]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And no one misguided us except the criminals.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][100]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So now we have no intercessors
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][101]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And not a devoted friend.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][102]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then if we only had a return [to the world] and could be of the believers... "
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][103]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][104]

\flushleft{
And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.

The people of Noah denied the messengers

So fear Allah and obey me."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

They said, "Should we believe you while you are followed by the lowest [class of people]?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][112]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "And what is my knowledge of what they used to do?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][113]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Their account is only upon my Lord, if you [could] perceive.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][114]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And I am not one to drive away the believers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][115]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
I am only a clear warner."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

They said, "If you do not desist, O Noah, you will surely be of those who are stoned."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][117]

\flushleft{
He said, "My Lord, indeed my people have denied me.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][118]

\flushleft{
Then judge between me and them with decisive judgement and save me and those with me of the believers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][119]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So We saved him and those with him in the laden ship.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][120]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We drowned thereafter the remaining ones.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.

They said, "If you do not desist, O Lot, you will surely be of those evicted."

My Lord, save me and my family from [the consequence of] what they do."

\flushleft{
So We saved him and his family, all,
}

\flushleft{
Except an old woman among those who remained behind.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Then We destroyed the others.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
And We rained upon them a rain [of stones], and evil was the rain of those who were warned.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][174]

\flushleft{
Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][175]

\flushleft{
And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.

The companions of the thicket denied the messengers

And I do not ask you for it any payment. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.

Give full measure and do not be of those who cause loss.

\flushleft{
Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.

And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.

Upon your heart, [O Muhammad] - that you may be of the warners -

In a clear Arabic language.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][196]

\flushleft{
And indeed, it is [mentioned] in the scriptures of former peoples.
}

And has it not been a sign to them that it is recognized by the scholars of the Children of Israel?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][198]

\flushleft{
And even if We had revealed it to one among the foreigners
}

\flushleft{
And he had recited it to them [perfectly], they would [still] not have been believers in it.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][200]

\flushleft{
Thus have We inserted disbelief into the hearts of the criminals.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][201]

\flushleft{
They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment.

And it will come to them suddenly while they perceive [it] not.

And they will say, "May we be reprieved?"

\flushleft{
So for Our punishment are they impatient?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][205]

\flushleft{
Then have you considered if We gave them enjoyment for years
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][206]

\flushleft{
And then there came to them that which they were promised?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][207]

\flushleft{
They would not be availed by the enjoyment with which they were provided.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][208]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We did not destroy any city except that it had warners
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][209]

\flushleft{
As a reminder; and never have We been unjust.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
And the devils have not brought the revelation down.
}

It is not allowable for them, nor would they be able.

\flushleft{
Indeed they, from [its] hearing, are removed.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

So do not invoke with Allah another deity and [thus] be among the punished.

\flushleft{
And warn, [O Muhammad], your closest kindred.
}

And lower your wing to those who follow you of the believers.

And if they disobey you, then say, "Indeed, I am disassociated from what you are doing."
}

\flushleft{
And rely upon the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,

\flushleft{
Who sees you when you arise
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][219]

\flushleft{
And your movement among those who prostrate.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.

Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend?

They descend upon every sinful liar.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
They pass on what is heard, and most of them are liars.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
And the poets - [only] the deviators follow them;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][225]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Do you not see that in every valley they roam
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][226]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And that they say what they do not do? -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[26][227]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Except those [poets] who believe and do righteous deeds and remember Allah often and defend [the Muslims] after they were wronged. And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned.

Ta, Seen. These are the verses of the Qur'an and a clear Book

As guidance and good tidings for the believers

Who establish prayer and give zakah, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].

Indeed, for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have made pleasing to them their deeds, so they wander blindly.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][5]

\flushleft{
Those are the ones for whom there will be the worst of punishment, and in the Hereafter they are the greatest losers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][6]

\flushleft{
And indeed, [O Muhammad], you receive the Qur'an from one Wise and Knowing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][7]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Mention] when Moses said to his family, "Indeed, I have perceived a fire. I will bring you from there information or will bring you a burning torch that you may warm yourselves."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][8]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But when he came to it, he was called, "Blessed is whoever is at the fire and whoever is around it. And exalted is Allah, Lord of the worlds.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][9]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
O Moses, indeed it is I - Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][10]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [he was told], "Throw down your staff." But when he saw it writhing as if it were a snake, he turned in flight and did not return. [Allah said], "O Moses, fear not. Indeed, in My presence the messengers do not fear.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][11]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Otherwise, he who wrongs, then substitutes good after evil - indeed, I am Forgiving and Merciful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][12]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And put your hand into the opening of your garment [at the breast]; it will come out white without disease. [These are] among the nine signs [you will take] to Pharaoh and his people. Indeed, they have been a people defiantly disobedient."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][13]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But when there came to them Our visible signs, they said, "This is obvious magic."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][14]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they rejected them, while their [inner] selves were convinced thereof, out of injustice and haughtiness. So see how was the end of the corrupters.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][15]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We had certainly given to David and Solomon knowledge, and they said, "Praise [is due] to Allah, who has favored us over many of His believing servants."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][16]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Solomon inherited David. He said, "O people, we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from all things. Indeed, this is evident bounty."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][17]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And gathered for Solomon were his soldiers of the jinn and men and birds, and they were [marching] in rows.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Until, when they came upon the valley of the ants, an ant said, "O ants, enter your dwellings that you not be crushed by Solomon and his soldiers while they perceive not."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So [Solomon] smiled, amused at her speech, and said, "My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which You approve. And admit me by Your mercy into [the ranks of] Your righteous servants."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he took attendance of the birds and said, "Why do I not see the hoopoe - or is he among the absent?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][21]

\flushleft{
I will surely punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings me clear authorization."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But the hoopoe stayed not long and said, "I have encompassed [in knowledge] that which you have not encompassed, and I have come to you from Sheba with certain news.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][23]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, I found [there] a woman ruling them, and she has been given of all things, and she has a great throne.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][24]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah, and Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from [His] way, so they are not guided,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][25]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[And] so they do not prostrate to Allah, who brings forth what is hidden within the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][26]

\flushleft{
Allah - there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Great Throne."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

[Solomon] said, "We will see whether you were truthful or were of the liars.

Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them. Then leave them and see what [answer] they will return."

She said, "O eminent ones, indeed, to me has been delivered a noble letter.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][30]

\flushleft{
Indeed, it is from Solomon, and indeed, it reads: 'In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][31]

\flushleft{
Be not haughty with me but come to me in submission [as Muslims].' "
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][32]
\end{Arabic}}

She said, "O eminent ones, advise me in my affair. I would not decide a matter until you witness [for] me."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][33]

\flushleft{
They said, "We are men of strength and of great military might, but the command is yours, so see what you will command."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][34]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
She said, "Indeed kings - when they enter a city, they ruin it and render the honored of its people humbled. And thus do they do.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][35]

\flushleft{
But indeed, I will send to them a gift and see with what [reply] the messengers will return."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So when they came to Solomon, he said, "Do you provide me with wealth? But what Allah has given me is better than what He has given you. Rather, it is you who rejoice in your gift.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Return to them, for we will surely come to them with soldiers that they will be powerless to encounter, and we will surely expel them therefrom in humiliation, and they will be debased."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Solomon] said, "O assembly [of jinn], which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][39]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
A powerful one from among the jinn said, "I will bring it to you before you rise from your place, and indeed, I am for this [task] strong and trustworthy."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][40]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Said one who had knowledge from the Scripture, "I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you." And when [Solomon] saw it placed before him, he said, "This is from the favor of my Lord to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful - his gratitude is only for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever is ungrateful - then indeed, my Lord is Free of need and Generous."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "Disguise for her her throne; we will see whether she will be guided [to truth] or will be of those who is not guided."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So when she arrived, it was said [to her], "Is your throne like this?" She said, "[It is] as though it was it." [Solomon said], "And we were given knowledge before her, and we have been Muslims [in submission to Allah].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And that which she was worshipping other than Allah had averted her [from submission to Him]. Indeed, she was from a disbelieving people."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
She was told, "Enter the palace." But when she saw it, she thought it was a body of water and uncovered her shins [to wade through]. He said, "Indeed, it is a palace [whose floor is] made smooth with glass." She said, "My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to Allah, Lord of the worlds."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][45]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We had certainly sent to Thamud their brother Salih, [saying], "Worship Allah," and at once they were two parties conflicting.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][46]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "O my people, why are you impatient for evil instead of good? Why do you not seek forgiveness of Allah that you may receive mercy?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][47]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "We consider you a bad omen, you and those with you." He said, "Your omen is with Allah. Rather, you are a people being tested."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][48]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And there were in the city nine family heads causing corruption in the land and not amending [its affairs].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][49]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "Take a mutual oath by Allah that we will kill him by night, he and his family. Then we will say to his executor, 'We did not witness the destruction of his family, and indeed, we are truthful.' "
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][50]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][51]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then look how was the outcome of their plan - that We destroyed them and their people, all.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][52]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So those are their houses, desolate because of the wrong they had done. Indeed in that is a sign for people who know.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][53]

\flushleft{
And We saved those who believed and used to fear Allah.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][54]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, "Do you commit immorality while you are seeing?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][55]

\flushleft{
Do you indeed approach men with desire instead of women? Rather, you are a people behaving ignorantly."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][56]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But the answer of his people was not except that they said, "Expel the family of Lot from your city. Indeed, they are people who keep themselves pure."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[27][57]

So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; We destined her to be of those who remained behind.

And We rained upon them a rain [of stones], and evil was the rain of those who were warned.

[More precisely], is He [not best] who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you rain from the sky, causing to grow thereby gardens of joyful beauty which you could not [otherwise] have grown the trees thereof?

We recite to you from the news of Moses and Pharaoh in truth for a people who believe.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][4]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions, oppressing a sector among them, slaughtering their [newborn] sons and keeping their females alive. Indeed, he was of the corrupters.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][5]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][6]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And establish them in the land and show Pharaoh and [his minister] Haman and their soldiers through them that which they had feared.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][7]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We inspired to the mother of Moses, "Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and will make him [one] of the messengers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][8]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And the family of Pharaoh picked him up [out of the river] so that he would become to them an enemy and a [cause of] grief. Indeed, Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers were deliberate sinners.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][9]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And the wife of Pharaoh said, "[He will be] a comfort of the eye for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son." And they perceived not.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][10]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And the heart of Moses' mother became empty [of all else]. She was about to disclose [the matter concerning] him had We not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][11]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And she said to his sister, "Follow him"; so she watched him from a distance while they perceived not.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][12]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We had prevented from him [all] wet nurses before, so she said, "Shall I direct you to a household that will be responsible for him for you while they are to him [for his upbringing] sincere?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][13]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So We restored him to his mother that she might be content and not grieve and that she would know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of the people do not know.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][14]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when he attained his full strength and was [mentally] mature, We bestowed upon him judgement and knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][15]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he entered the city at a time of inattention by its people and found therein two men fighting: one from his faction and one from among his enemy. And the one from his faction called for help to him against the one from his enemy, so Moses struck him and [unintentionally] killed him. [Moses] said, "This is from the work of Satan. Indeed, he is a manifest, misleading enemy."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][16]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me," and He forgave him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][17]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "My Lord, for the favor You bestowed upon me, I will never be an assistant to the criminals."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he became inside the city fearful and anticipating [exposure], when suddenly the one who sought his help the previous day cried out to him [once again]. Moses said to him, "Indeed, you are an evident, [persistent] deviator."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, he said, "O Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed someone yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And a man came from the farthest end of the city, running. He said, "O Moses, indeed the eminent ones are conferring over you [intending] to kill you, so leave [the city]; indeed, I am to you of the sincere advisors."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][21]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So he left it, fearful and anticipating [apprehension]. He said, "My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when he directed himself toward Madyan, he said, "Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the sound way."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][23]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when he came to the well of Madyan, he found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and he found aside from them two women driving back [their flocks]. He said, "What is your circumstance?" They said, "We do not water until the shepherds dispatch [their flocks]; and our father is an old man."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][24]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, "My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][25]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness. She said, "Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us." So when he came to him and related to him the story, he said, "Fear not. You have escaped from the wrongdoing people."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][26]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
One of the women said, "O my father, hire him. Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][27]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "Indeed, I wish to wed you one of these, my two daughters, on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be [as a favor] from you. And I do not wish to put you in difficulty. You will find me, if Allah wills, from among the righteous."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][28]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Moses] said, "That is [established] between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete - there is no injustice to me, and Allah, over what we say, is Witness."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when Moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family, he perceived from the direction of the mount a fire. He said to his family, "Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire. Perhaps I will bring you from there [some] information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][30]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But when he came to it, he was called from the right side of the valley in a blessed spot - from the tree, "O Moses, indeed I am Allah, Lord of the worlds."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [he was told], "Throw down your staff." But when he saw it writhing as if it was a snake, he turned in flight and did not return. [Allah said], "O Moses, approach and fear not. Indeed, you are of the secure.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Insert your hand into the opening of your garment; it will come out white, without disease. And draw in your arm close to you [as prevention] from fear, for those are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his establishment. Indeed, they have been a people defiantly disobedient."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "My Lord, indeed, I killed from among them someone, and I fear they will kill me.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][34]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And my brother Aaron is more fluent than me in tongue, so send him with me as support, verifying me. Indeed, I fear that they will deny me."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][35]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Allah] said, "We will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you. [It will be] through Our signs; you and those who follow you will be the predominant."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But when Moses came to them with Our signs as clear evidences, they said, "This is not except invented magic, and we have not heard of this [religion] among our forefathers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Moses said, "My Lord is more knowing [than we or you] of who has come with guidance from Him and to whom will be succession in the home. Indeed, wrongdoers do not succeed."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Pharaoh said, "O eminent ones, I have not known you to have a god other than me. Then ignite for me, O Haman, [a fire] upon the clay and make for me a tower that I may look at the God of Moses. And indeed, I do think he is among the liars."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][39]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he was arrogant, he and his soldiers, in the land, without right, and they thought that they would not be returned to Us.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][40]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So We took him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea. So see how was the end of the wrongdoers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][41]

\flushleft{
And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][42]

And We caused to overtake them in this world a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be of the despised.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We gave Moses the Scripture, after We had destroyed the former generations, as enlightenment for the people and guidance and mercy that they might be reminded.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And you, [O Muhammad], were not on the western side [of the mount] when We revealed to Moses the command, and you were not among the witnesses [to that].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][45]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But We produced [many] generations [after Moses], and prolonged was their duration. And you were not a resident among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our verses, but We were senders [of this message].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][46]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And you were not at the side of the mount when We called [Moses] but [were sent] as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you that they might be reminded.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][47]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And if not that a disaster should strike them for what their hands put forth [of sins] and they would say, "Our Lord, why did You not send us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses and been among the believers?"...
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][48]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, "Why was he not given like that which was given to Moses?" Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Moses before? They said, "[They are but] two works of magic supporting each other, and indeed we are, in both, disbelievers."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[28][49]

\flushleft{
But if they do not respond to you - then know that they only follow their [own] desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.

And We have [repeatedly] conveyed to them the Qur'an that they might be reminded.

Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it - they are believers in it.

And when they hear ill speech, they turn away from it and say, "For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. Peace will be upon you; we seek not the ignorant."

Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided.

\flushleft{
And the Horn will be blown; and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][52]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will say, "O woe to us! Who has raised us up from our sleeping place?" [The reply will be], "This is what the Most Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][53]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
It will not be but one blast, and at once they are all brought present before Us.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][54]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So today no soul will be wronged at all, and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][55]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed the companions of Paradise, that Day, will be amused in [joyful] occupation -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][56]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They and their spouses - in shade, reclining on adorned couches.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][57]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
For them therein is fruit, and for them is whatever they request [or wish]
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][58]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[And] "Peace," a word from a Merciful Lord.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][59]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Then He will say], "But stand apart today, you criminals.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][60]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][61]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][62]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he had already led astray from among you much of creation, so did you not use reason?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][63]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
This is the Hellfire which you were promised.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][64]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Enter to] burn therein today for what you used to deny."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][65]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
That Day, We will seal over their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify about what they used to earn.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][66]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And if We willed, We could have obliterated their eyes, and they would race to [find] the path, and how could they see?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][67]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And if We willed, We could have deformed them, [paralyzing them] in their places so they would not be able to proceed, nor could they return.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][68]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he to whom We grant long life We reverse in creation; so will they not understand?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][69]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We did not give Prophet Muhammad, knowledge of poetry, nor is it befitting for him. It is not but a message and a clear Qur'an
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][70]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
To warn whoever is alive and justify the word against the disbelievers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][71]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Do they not see that We have created for them from what Our hands have made, grazing livestock, and [then] they are their owners?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][72]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We have tamed them for them, so some of them they ride, and some of them they eat.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][73]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And for them therein are [other] benefits and drinks, so will they not be grateful?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But they have taken besides Allah [false] deities that perhaps they would be helped.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They are not able to help them, and they [themselves] are for them soldiers in attendance.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][76]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So let not their speech grieve you. Indeed, We know what they conceal and what they declare.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][77]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Does man not consider that We created him from a [mere] sperm-drop - then at once he is a clear adversary?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he presents for Us an example and forgets his [own] creation. He says, "Who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][79]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Say, "He will give them life who produced them the first time; and He is, of all creation, Knowing."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][80]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[It is] He who made for you from the green tree, fire, and then from it you ignite.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][81]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them? Yes, [it is so]; and He is the Knowing Creator.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][82]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, "Be," and it is.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[36][83]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned.

\chapter{As-Saffat (Those Ranging in Ranks)}
\begin{Arabic}
\Huge{\centerline{\basmalah}}\end{Arabic}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][1]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
By those [angels] lined up in rows
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][2]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And those who drive [the clouds]
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][3]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And those who recite the message,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][4]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, your God is One,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][5]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Lord of the heavens and the earth and that between them and Lord of the sunrises.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][6]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][7]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And as protection against every rebellious devil
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][8]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[So] they may not listen to the exalted assembly [of angels] and are pelted from every side,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][9]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Repelled; and for them is a constant punishment,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][10]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Except one who snatches [some words] by theft, but they are pursued by a burning flame, piercing [in brightness].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][11]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then inquire of them, [O Muhammad], "Are they a stronger [or more difficult] creation or those [others] We have created?" Indeed, We created men from sticky clay.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][12]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But you wonder, while they mock,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][13]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when they are reminded, they remember not.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][14]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when they see a sign, they ridicule
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][15]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And say, "This is not but obvious magic.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][16]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When we have died and become dust and bones, are we indeed to be resurrected?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][17]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And our forefathers [as well]?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Say, "Yes, and you will be [rendered] contemptible."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
It will be only one shout, and at once they will be observing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will say, "O woe to us! This is the Day of Recompense."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][21]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[They will be told], "This is the Day of Judgement which you used to deny."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[The angels will be ordered], "Gather those who committed wrong, their kinds, and what they used to worship
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][23]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Other than Allah, and guide them to the path of Hellfire
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][24]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And stop them; indeed, they are to be questioned."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][25]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[They will be asked], "What is [wrong] with you? Why do you not help each other?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][26]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But they, that Day, are in surrender.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][27]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they will approach one another blaming each other.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][28]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They will say, "Indeed, you used to come at us from the right."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The oppressors will say, "Rather, you [yourselves] were not believers,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][30]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And we had over you no authority, but you were a transgressing people.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So the word of our Lord has come into effect upon us; indeed, we will taste [punishment].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And we led you to deviation; indeed, we were deviators."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So indeed they, that Day, will be sharing in the punishment.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][34]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, that is how We deal with the criminals.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][35]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed they, when it was said to them, "There is no deity but Allah," were arrogant
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And were saying, "Are we to leave our gods for a mad poet?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Rather, the Prophet has come with the truth and confirmed the [previous] messengers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, you [disbelievers] will be tasters of the painful punishment,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][39]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][40]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But not the chosen servants of Allah.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Those will have a provision determined -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Fruits; and they will be honored
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
In gardens of pleasure
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
On thrones facing one another.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][45]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
There will be circulated among them a cup [of wine] from a flowing spring,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][46]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
White and delicious to the drinkers;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][47]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
No bad effect is there in it, nor from it will they be intoxicated.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][48]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And with them will be women limiting [their] glances, with large, [beautiful] eyes,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][49]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
As if they were [delicate] eggs, well-protected.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][50]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they will approach one another, inquiring of each other.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][51]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
A speaker among them will say, "Indeed, I had a companion [on earth]
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][52]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Who would say, 'Are you indeed of those who believe
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][53]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
That when we have died and become dust and bones, we will indeed be recompensed?'"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][54]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He will say, "Would you [care to] look?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][55]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he will look and see him in the midst of the Hellfire.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][56]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He will say, "By Allah, you almost ruined me.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][57]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
If not for the favor of my Lord, I would have been of those brought in [to Hell].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][58]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then, are we not to die
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][59]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Except for our first death, and we will not be punished?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][60]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, this is the great attainment.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][61]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
For the like of this let the workers [on earth] work.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][62]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Is Paradise a better accommodation or the tree of zaqqum?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][63]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, We have made it a torment for the wrongdoers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][64]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, it is a tree issuing from the bottom of the Hellfire,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][65]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Its emerging fruit as if it was heads of the devils.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][66]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And indeed, they will eat from it and fill with it their bellies.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][67]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then indeed, they will have after it a mixture of scalding water.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][68]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then indeed, their return will be to the Hellfire.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][69]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed they found their fathers astray.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][70]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So they hastened [to follow] in their footsteps.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][71]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And there had already strayed before them most of the former peoples,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][72]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We had already sent among them warners.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][73]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then look how was the end of those who were warned -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][74]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But not the chosen servants of Allah.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][75]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Noah had certainly called Us, and [We are] the best of responders.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][76]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We saved him and his family from the great affliction.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][77]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We made his descendants those remaining [on the earth]
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][78]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And left for him [favorable mention] among later generations:
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][79]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
"Peace upon Noah among the worlds."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][80]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][81]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, he was of Our believing servants.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][82]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We drowned the disbelievers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][83]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And indeed, among his kind was Abraham,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][84]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When he came to his Lord with a sound heart
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][85]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[And] when he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][86]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Is it falsehood [as] gods other than Allah you desire?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][87]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then what is your thought about the Lord of the worlds?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][88]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he cast a look at the stars
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][89]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And said, "Indeed, I am [about to be] ill."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][90]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So they turned away from him, departing.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][91]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then he turned to their gods and said, "Do you not eat?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][92]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
What is [wrong] with you that you do not speak?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][93]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he turned upon them a blow with [his] right hand.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][94]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then the people came toward him, hastening.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][95]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "Do you worship that which you [yourselves] carve,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][96]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
While Allah created you and that which you do?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][97]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
They said, "Construct for him a furnace and throw him into the burning fire."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][98]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they intended for him a plan, but We made them the most debased.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][99]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [then] he said, "Indeed, I will go to [where I am ordered by] my Lord; He will guide me.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][100]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
My Lord, grant me [a child] from among the righteous."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][101]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][102]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when he reached with him [the age of] exertion, he said, "O my son, indeed I have seen in a dream that I [must] sacrifice you, so see what you think." He said, "O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, of the steadfast."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][103]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when they had both submitted and he put him down upon his forehead,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][104]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
We called to him, "O Abraham,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][105]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
You have fulfilled the vision." Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][106]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, this was the clear trial.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][107]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][108]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We left for him [favorable mention] among later generations:
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][109]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
"Peace upon Abraham."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][110]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][111]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, he was of Our believing servants.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][112]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We gave him good tidings of Isaac, a prophet from among the righteous.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][113]

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][114]

\flushleft{
And We did certainly confer favor upon Moses and Aaron.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][115]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We saved them and their people from the great affliction,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][116]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We supported them so it was they who overcame.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][117]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We gave them the explicit Scripture,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][118]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We guided them on the straight path.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][119]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We left for them [favorable mention] among later generations:
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][120]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
"Peace upon Moses and Aaron."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][121]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][122]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, they were of Our believing servants.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][123]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And indeed, Elias was from among the messengers,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][124]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When he said to his people, "Will you not fear Allah?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][125]

\flushleft{
Do you call upon Ba'l and leave the best of creators -

\quranayah[37][126]

\flushleft{
Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][127]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they denied him, so indeed, they will be brought [for punishment],
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][128]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Except the chosen servants of Allah.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][129]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We left for him [favorable mention] among later generations:
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][130]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
"Peace upon Elias."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.

\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, he was of Our believing servants.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][133]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And indeed, Lot was among the messengers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][134]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[So mention] when We saved him and his family, all,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][135]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Except his wife among those who remained [with the evildoers].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][136]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then We destroyed the others.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][137]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And indeed, you pass by them in the morning
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][138]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And at night. Then will you not use reason?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][139]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And indeed, Jonah was among the messengers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][140]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Mention] when he ran away to the laden ship.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][141]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he drew lots and was among the losers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][142]

\flushleft{
Then the fish swallowed him, while he was blameworthy.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][143]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And had he not been of those who exalt Allah,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][144]

\flushleft{
He would have remained inside its belly until the Day they are resurrected.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][145]

\flushleft{
But We threw him onto the open shore while he was ill.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][146]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We caused to grow over him a gourd vine.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][147]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We sent him to [his people of] a hundred thousand or more.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][148]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they believed, so We gave them enjoyment [of life] for a time.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][149]

\flushleft{
So inquire of them, [O Muhammad], "Does your Lord have daughters while they have sons?

\flushleft{
Or did We create the angels as females while they were witnesses?"
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][151]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Unquestionably, it is out of their [invented] falsehood that they say,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][152]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
" Allah has begotten," and indeed, they are liars.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Has He chosen daughters over sons?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
What is [wrong] with you? How do you make judgement?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][155]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then will you not be reminded?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][156]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or do you have a clear authority?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][157]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then produce your scripture, if you should be truthful.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][158]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they have claimed between Him and the jinn a lineage, but the jinn have already known that they [who made such claims] will be brought to [punishment].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][159]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Exalted is Allah above what they describe,

\flushleft{
Except the chosen servants of Allah [who do not share in that sin].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][161]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So indeed, you [disbelievers] and whatever you worship,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][162]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
You cannot tempt [anyone] away from Him
}

Except he who is to [enter and] burn in the Hellfire.

[The angels say], "There is not among us any except that he has a known position.

And indeed, we are those who line up [for prayer].

\flushleft{
And indeed, we are those who exalt Allah."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][167]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And indeed, the disbelievers used to say,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][168]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
"If we had a message from [those of] the former peoples,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
We would have been the chosen servants of Allah."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][170]

\flushleft{
But they disbelieved in it, so they are going to know.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][171]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And Our word has already preceded for Our servants, the messengers,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][172]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[That] indeed, they would be those given victory
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][173]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [that] indeed, Our soldiers will be those who overcome.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][174]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So, [O Muhammad], leave them for a time.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][175]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And see [what will befall] them, for they are going to see.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][176]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then for Our punishment are they impatient?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[37][177]

\flushleft{
But when it descends in their territory, then evil is the morning of those who were warned.
}

\flushleft{
And leave them for a time.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

And see, for they are going to see.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

Exalted is your Lord, the Lord of might, above what they describe.

And peace upon the messengers.

\flushleft{
Sad. By the Qur'an containing reminder...

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][2]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But those who disbelieve are in pride and dissension.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][3]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
How many a generation have We destroyed before them, and they [then] called out; but it was not a time for escape.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][4]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves. And the disbelievers say, "This is a magician and a liar.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][5]

\flushleft{
Has he made the gods [only] one God? Indeed, this is a curious thing."

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][6]

\flushleft{
And the eminent among them went forth, [saying], "Continue, and be patient over [the defense of] your gods. Indeed, this is a thing intended.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][7]

\flushleft{
We have not heard of this in the latest religion. This is not but a fabrication.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][8]

\flushleft{
Has the message been revealed to him out of [all of] us?" Rather, they are in doubt about My message. Rather, they have not yet tasted My punishment.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][9]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or do they have the depositories of the mercy of your Lord, the Exalted in Might, the Bestower?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][10]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or is theirs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them? Then let them ascend through [any] ways of access.

\flushleft{
[They are but] soldiers [who will be] defeated there among the companies [of disbelievers].

The people of Noah denied before them, and [the tribe of] 'Aad and Pharaoh, the owner of stakes,

And [the tribe of] Thamud and the people of Lot and the companions of the thicket. Those are the companies.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][14]

\flushleft{
Each of them denied the messengers, so My penalty was justified.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][15]

And these [disbelievers] await not but one blast [of the Horn]; for it there will be no delay.

And they say, "Our Lord, hasten for us our share [of the punishment] before the Day of Account"

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][17]

\flushleft{
Be patient over what they say and remember Our servant, David, the possessor of strength; indeed, he was one who repeatedly turned back [to Allah].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][18]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, We subjected the mountains [to praise] with him, exalting [Allah] in the [late] afternoon and [after] sunrise.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][19]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And the birds were assembled, all with him repeating [praises].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and discernment in speech.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][21]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And has there come to you the news of the adversaries, when they climbed over the wall of [his] prayer chamber -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When they entered upon David and he was alarmed by them? They said, "Fear not. [We are] two adversaries, one of whom has wronged the other, so judge between us with truth and do not exceed [it] and guide us to the sound path.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][23]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed this, my brother, has ninety-nine ewes, and I have one ewe; so he said, 'Entrust her to me,' and he overpowered me in speech."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][24]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[David] said, "He has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe [in addition] to his ewes. And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds - and few are they." And David became certain that We had tried him, and he asked forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing [in prostration] and turned in repentance [to Allah].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][25]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So We forgave him that; and indeed, for him is nearness to Us and a good place of return.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][26]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[We said], "O David, indeed We have made you a successor upon the earth, so judge between the people in truth and do not follow [your own] desire, as it will lead you astray from the way of Allah." Indeed, those who go astray from the way of Allah will have a severe punishment for having forgotten the Day of Account.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][27]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We did not create the heaven and the earth and that between them aimlessly. That is the assumption of those who disbelieve, so woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][28]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Or should we treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like corrupters in the land? Or should We treat those who fear Allah like the wicked?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[This is] a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][30]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And to David We gave Solomon. An excellent servant, indeed he was one repeatedly turning back [to Allah].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[Mention] when there were exhibited before him in the afternoon the poised [standing] racehorses.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And he said, "Indeed, I gave preference to the love of good [things] over the remembrance of my Lord until the sun disappeared into the curtain [of darkness]."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[He said], "Return them to me," and set about striking [their] legs and necks.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][34]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We certainly tried Solomon and placed on his throne a body; then he returned.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][35]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
He said, "My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyone after me. Indeed, You are the Bestower."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][36]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So We subjected to him the wind blowing by his command, gently, wherever he directed,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And [also] the devils [of jinn] - every builder and diver
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And others bound together in shackles.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][39]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[We said], "This is Our gift, so grant or withhold without account."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][40]

\flushleft{
And indeed, for him is nearness to Us and a good place of return.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And remember Our servant Job, when he called to his Lord, "Indeed, Satan has touched me with hardship and torment."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[So he was told], "Strike [the ground] with your foot; this is a [spring for] a cool bath and drink."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And We granted him his family and a like [number] with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for those of understanding.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[We said], "And take in your hand a bunch [of grass] and strike with it and do not break your oath." Indeed, We found him patient, an excellent servant. Indeed, he was one repeatedly turning back [to Allah].
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][45]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And remember Our servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob - those of strength and [religious] vision.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][46]

\flushleft{
Indeed, We chose them for an exclusive quality: remembrance of the home [of the Hereafter].

\quranayah[38][47]

\flushleft{
And indeed they are, to Us, among the chosen and outstanding.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][48]

\flushleft{
And remember Ishmael, Elisha and Dhul-Kifl, and all are among the outstanding.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][49]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
This is a reminder. And indeed, for the righteous is a good place of return
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][50]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Gardens of perpetual residence, whose doors will be opened to them.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][51]

\flushleft{
Reclining within them, they will call therein for abundant fruit and drink.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][52]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And with them will be women limiting [their] glances and of equal age.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][53]

\flushleft{
This is what you, [the righteous], are promised for the Day of Account.

Indeed, this is Our provision; for it there is no depletion.

\flushleft{
This [is so]. But indeed, for the transgressors is an evil place of return -

\flushleft{
Hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretched is the resting place.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[38][57]

\flushleft{
This - so let them taste it - is scalding water and [foul] purulence.

And other [punishments] of its type [in various] kinds.

Is it [because] we took them in ridicule, or has [our] vision turned away from them?"

Indeed, that is truth - the quarreling of the people of the Fire.

Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those who were before them? They were greater than them in strength and in impression on the land, but Allah seized them for their sins. And they had not from Allah any protector.

\quranayah[40][22]

That was because their messengers were coming to them with clear proofs, but they disbelieved, so Allah seized them. Indeed, He is Powerful and severe in punishment.

And We did certainly send Moses with Our signs and a clear authority

And when he brought them the truth from Us, they said, "Kill the sons of those who have believed with him and keep their women alive." But the plan of the disbelievers is not except in error.

O my people, sovereignty is yours today, [your being] dominant in the land. But who would protect us from the punishment of Allah if it came to us?" Pharaoh said, "I do not show you except what I see, and I do not guide you except to the way of right conduct."

And Joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs, but you remained in doubt of that which he brought to you, until when he died, you said, 'Never will Allah send a messenger after him.' Thus does Allah leave astray he who is a transgressor and skeptic."

Indeed, those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah without [any] authority having come to them - there is not within their breasts except pride, [the extent of] which they cannot reach. So seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Seeing.

And Pharaoh called out among his people; he said, "O my people, does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these rivers flowing beneath me; then do you not see?

Then why have there not been placed upon him bracelets of gold or come with him the angels in conjunction?"

And when they angered Us, We took retribution from them and drowned them all.

And when the son of Mary was presented as an example, immediately your people laughed aloud.

On that night is made distinct every precise matter -

[Every] matter [proceeding] from Us. Indeed, We were to send [a messenger]

Thus. And We caused to inherit it another people.

And the heaven and earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved.

\flushleft{
And We certainly saved the Children of Israel from the humiliating torment -

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[44][31]

\flushleft{
From Pharaoh. Indeed, he was a haughty one among the transgressors.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

And We certainly chose them by knowledge over [all] the worlds.

And We did not create the heavens and earth and that between them in play.

Indeed, the Day of Judgement is the appointed time for them all -

They will not taste death therein except the first death, and He will have protected them from the punishment of Hellfire

As bounty from your Lord. That is what is the great attainment.

Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that Allah may enrage by them the disbelievers. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.

And they were unable to arise, nor could they defend themselves.

And [We destroyed] the people of Noah before; indeed, they were a people defiantly disobedient.

And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander.

So flee to Allah. Indeed, I am to you from Him a clear warner.

And do not make [as equal] with Allah another deity. Indeed, I am to you from Him a clear warner.

Similarly, there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said, "A magician or a madman."

Did they suggest it to them? Rather, they [themselves] are a transgressing people.

So leave them, [O Muhammad], for you are not to be blamed.

I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed Me.

[They will be told], "Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do."

There will circulate among them [servant] boys [especially] for them, as if they were pearls well-protected.

And they will approach one another, inquiring of each other.

They will say, "Indeed, we were previously among our people fearful [of displeasing Allah].

So remind [O Muhammad], for you are not, by the favor of your Lord, a soothsayer or a madman.

Say, "Wait, for indeed I am, with you, among the waiters."

Or do they say, "He has made it up"? Rather, they do not believe.

Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain.

Or have they the depositories [containing the provision] of your Lord? Or are they the controllers [of them]?

Or have they a stairway [into the heaven] upon which they listen? Then let their listener produce a clear authority.

\flushleft{
Or has He daughters while you have sons?

Or do you, [O Muhammad], ask of them a payment, so they are by debt burdened down?

Or have they [knowledge of] the unseen, so they write [it] down?

Or do they intend a plan? But those who disbelieve - they are the object of a plan.

Or have they a deity other than Allah? Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him.

So leave them until they meet their Day in which they will be struck insensible -

The Day their plan will not avail them at all, nor will they be helped.

And indeed, for those who have wronged is a punishment before that, but most of them do not know.

And be patient, [O Muhammad], for the decision of your Lord, for indeed, you are in Our eyes. And exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord when you arise.

Your companion [Muhammad] has not strayed, nor has he erred,

\flushleft{
Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][4]

\flushleft{
It is not but a revelation revealed,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Taught to him by one intense in strength -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][6]

\flushleft{
One of soundness. And he rose to [his] true form
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][7]

\flushleft{
While he was in the higher [part of the] horizon.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Then he approached and descended
}

\flushleft{
And was at a distance of two bow lengths or nearer.

\flushleft{
And he revealed to His Servant what he revealed.
}

The heart did not lie [about] what it saw.

So will you dispute with him over what he saw?

And he certainly saw him in another descent

At the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary -

Near it is the Garden of Refuge -

When there covered the Lote Tree that which covered [it].

The sight [of the Prophet] did not swerve, nor did it transgress [its limit].

He certainly saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.

So have you considered al-Lat and al-'Uzza?

Is the male for you and for Him the female?

\flushleft{
That, then, is an unjust division.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][23]

\flushleft{
They are not but [mere] names you have named them - you and your forefathers - for which Allah has sent down no authority. They follow not except assumption and what [their] souls desire, and there has already come to them from their Lord guidance.

Or is there for man whatever he wishes?

And how many angels there are in the heavens whose intercession will not avail at all except [only] after Allah has permitted [it] to whom He wills and approves.

Indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter name the angels female names,

So turn away from whoever turns his back on Our message and desires not except the worldly life.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

That is their sum of knowledge. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who strays from His way, and He is most knowing of who is guided.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[53][31]

And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth - that He may recompense those who do evil with [the penalty of] what they have done and recompense those who do good with the best [reward] -
}

\quranayah[53][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Those who avoid the major sins and immoralities, only [committing] slight ones. Indeed, your Lord is vast in forgiveness. He was most knowing of you when He produced you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers. So do not claim yourselves to be pure; He is most knowing of who fears Him.

Have you seen the one who turned away

\flushleft{
And gave a little and [then] refrained?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Does he have knowledge of the unseen, so he sees?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Or has he not been informed of what was in the scriptures of Moses
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
And [of] Abraham, who fulfilled [his obligations] -

\flushleft{
That no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives

And that his effort is going to be seen -

And that to your Lord is the finality

From a sperm-drop when it is emitted

And that [incumbent] upon Him is the next creation

And the people of Noah before. Indeed, it was they who were [even] more unjust and oppressing.

\flushleft{
And the overturned towns He hurled down

And covered them by that which He covered.

This [Prophet] is a warner like the former warners.

The Approaching Day has approached.

Of it, [from those] besides Allah, there is no remover.

Then at this statement do you wonder?

And you laugh and do not weep

So he invoked his Lord, "Indeed, I am overpowered, so help."

Allah presents an example of those who disbelieved: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two of Our righteous servants but betrayed them, so those prophets did not avail them from Allah at all, and it was said, "Enter the Fire with those who enter."

Then into Hellfire drive him.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits insert him."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[69][33]

\flushleft{
Indeed, he did not used to believe in Allah, the Most Great,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[69][34]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Nor did he encourage the feeding of the poor.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[69][35]

So there is not for him here this Day any devoted friend

\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Nor any food except from the discharge of wounds;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[69][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
None will eat it except the sinners.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[69][38]

So I swear by what you see
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[69][39]

And what you do not see
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
[That] indeed, the Qur'an is the word of a noble Messenger.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
And it is not the word of a poet; little do you believe.

Nor the word of a soothsayer; little do you remember.
}

[It is] a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.
}

\flushleft{
And if Muhammad had made up about Us some [false] sayings,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[69][45]

\flushleft{
We would have seized him by the right hand;
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[69][46]

\flushleft{
Then We would have cut from him the aorta.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
And there is no one of you who could prevent [Us] from him.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

And indeed, the Qur'an is a reminder for the righteous.

\flushleft{
And indeed, We know that among you are deniers.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[69][50]

And indeed, it will be [a cause of] regret upon the disbelievers.

And indeed, it is the truth of certainty.

A supplicant asked for a punishment bound to happen

\flushleft{
To the disbelievers; of it there is no preventer.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

[It is] from Allah, owner of the ways of ascent.
}

The angels and the Spirit will ascend to Him during a Day the extent of which is fifty thousand years.

So be patient with gracious patience.

Indeed, they see it [as] distant,

But We see it [as] near.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

On the Day the sky will be like murky oil,

\flushleft{
And the mountains will be like wool,
}

\flushleft{
And no friend will ask [anything of] a friend,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][11]

They will be shown each other. The criminal will wish that he could be ransomed from the punishment of that Day by his children

And his wife and his brother

And whoever is on earth entirely [so] then it could save him.

\flushleft{
No! Indeed, it is the Flame [of Hell],
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][16]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
A remover of exteriors.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][17]

\flushleft{
It invites he who turned his back [on truth] and went away [from obedience]

\flushleft{
And collected [wealth] and hoarded.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Indeed, mankind was created anxious:
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][20]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
When evil touches him, impatient,
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][21]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And when good touches him, withholding [of it],
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][22]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Except the observers of prayer -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Those who are constant in their prayer
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

And those within whose wealth is a known right

For the petitioner and the deprived -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
And those who believe in the Day of Recompense
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][27]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And those who are fearful of the punishment of their Lord -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][28]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Indeed, the punishment of their Lord is not that from which one is safe -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][29]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And those who guard their private parts
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][30]

Except from their wives or those their right hands possess, for indeed, they are not to be blamed -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][31]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
But whoever seeks beyond that, then they are the transgressors -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][32]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And those who are to their trusts and promises attentive
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][33]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
And those who are in their testimonies upright
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][34]

\flushleft{
And those who [carefully] maintain their prayer:
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][35]

\flushleft{
They will be in gardens, honored.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][36]

\flushleft{
So what is [the matter] with those who disbelieve, hastening [from] before you, [O Muhammad],
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][37]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
[To sit] on [your] right and [your] left in separate groups?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][38]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Does every person among them aspire to enter a garden of pleasure?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][39]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
No! Indeed, We have created them from that which they know.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][40]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So I swear by the Lord of [all] risings and settings that indeed We are able
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][41]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
To replace them with better than them; and We are not to be outdone.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][42]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
So leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their Day which they are promised -
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][43]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
The Day they will emerge from the graves rapidly as if they were, toward an erected idol, hastening.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[70][44]
\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Their eyes humbled, humiliation will cover them. That is the Day which they had been promised.

Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, [saying], "Warn your people before there comes to them a painful punishment."
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}
\quranayah[71][2]

He said, "O my people, indeed I am to you a clear warner,

[Saying], 'Worship Allah, fear Him and obey me.

Allah will forgive you of your sins and delay you for a specified term. Indeed, the time [set by] Allah, when it comes, will not be delayed, if you only knew.' "

He said, "My Lord, indeed I invited my people [to truth] night and day.

But my invitation increased them not except in flight.

And indeed, every time I invited them that You may forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears, covered themselves with their garments, persisted, and were arrogant with [great] arrogance.

\end{Arabic}}
\flushleft{
Then I invited them publicly.

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Then I announced to them and [also] confided to them secretly

\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

And said, 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver.

He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers

\flushleft{
While He has created you in stages?
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

\flushleft{
Do you not consider how Allah has created seven heavens in layers

And Allah has caused you to grow from the earth a [progressive] growth.

Then He will return you into it and extract you [another] extraction.

Indeed, your Lord knows, [O Muhammad], that you stand [in prayer] almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it, and [so do] a group of those with you. And Allah determines [the extent of] the night and the day. He has known that you [Muslims] will not be able to do it and has turned to you in forgiveness, so recite what is easy [for you] of the Qur'an. He has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling throughout the land seeking [something] of the bounty of Allah and others fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakah and loan Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. It is better and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

Leave Me with the one I created alone

And what can make you know what is Saqar?

It lets nothing remain and leaves nothing [unburned],

Blackening the skins.

Over it are nineteen [angels].

And We have not made the keepers of the Fire except angels.

Thus does Allah leave astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And none knows the soldiers of your Lord except Him. And mention of the Fire is not but a reminder to humanity.

To whoever wills among you to proceed or stay behind.

[And asking them], "What put you into Saqar?"

They will say, "We were not of those who prayed,

Nor did we used to feed the poor.
}

Until there came to us the certainty."

Then what is [the matter] with them that they are, from the reminder, turning away

Fleeing from a lion?

Rather, every person among them desires that he would be given scriptures spread about.

\flushleft{
No! But they do not fear the Hereafter.

\flushleft{
No! Indeed, the Qur'an is a reminder
}

Then whoever wills will remember it.
}

Yes. [We are] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips.

But man desires to continue in sin.

\flushleft{
He asks, "When is the Day of Resurrection?"

So when vision is dazzled

No! There is no refuge.

No! When the soul has reached the collar bones

Woe to you, and woe!

Had he not been a sperm from semen emitted?

An appropriate recompense.

The Day that the Spirit and the angels will stand in rows, they will not speak except for one whom the Most Merciful permits, and he will say what is correct.

Even if we should be decayed bones?

"Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed.

And let me guide you to your Lord so you would fear [Him]?'"

And he showed him the greatest sign,

But Pharaoh denied and disobeyed.

Then he turned his back, striving.

And he gathered [his people] and called out

And said, "I am your most exalted lord."

So Allah seized him in exemplary punishment for the last and the first [transgression].

Indeed in that is a warning for whoever would fear [Allah].

\flushleft{
Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven? Allah constructed it.

And after that He spread the earth.

He extracted from it its water and its pasture,

Then indeed, Paradise will be [his] refuge.

He who fears [Allah] will be reminded.

Working [hard] and exhausted.

They will [enter to] burn in an intensely hot Fire.

They will be given drink from a boiling spring.

For them there will be no food except from a poisonous, thorny plant

Wherein they will hear no unsuitable speech.

So remind, [O Muhammad]; you are only a reminder.

However, he who turns away and disbelieves -

Then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment.

[With] Iram - who had lofty pillars,

But when He tries him and restricts his provision, he says, "My Lord has humiliated me."

\flushleft{
No! But you do not honor the orphan

\flushleft{
And you do not encourage one another to feed the poor.

And you love wealth with immense love.
}
\flushright{\begin{Arabic}

No! When the earth has been leveled - pounded and crushed -

And your Lord has come and the angels, rank upon rank,

He will say, "Oh, I wish I had sent ahead [some good] for my life."

So on that Day, none will punish [as severely] as His punishment,

And what can make you know what is [breaking through] the difficult pass?

It is the freeing of a slave

Or feeding on a day of severe hunger
